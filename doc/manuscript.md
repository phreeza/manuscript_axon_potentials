title: Extracellular potentials generated by axonal projections are shaped by patterns of bifurcations and terminations

date: \today

abstract: Extracellular field potentials are an important source of information in neuroscience. Despite sustained efforts to understand their physiological basis, the origins of the extracellular field potentials in the brain are in many cases still a matter of debate. Axonal sources are frequently discounted, and rarely included in models. In this study, we examined the contributions of axons to these potentials. We used a detailed biophysical model as well as a simplified analytical model. Both models showed strong and far reaching contributions to the extracellular field potential. The contributions were especially strong when there was a zone in which the axons branch and terminate in close succession. This type of axonal structure is found in many brain regions and referred to as a terminal zone. Our models predicted a strong dipolar component originating from these structures, including a characteristic polarity reversal at the center of the terminal zone. We compared these models to data obtained from the barn owl brainstem. Axons in nucleus laminaris form stereotypical terminal zones characterized by strong extracellular potential. We recorded the responses to monaural clicks at different locations throughout nucleus laminaris using a multielectrode array. The data showed the spatiotemporal structure of the potentials to be in accordance with our models. Our results demonstrate that axons contribute more to extracellular field potentials in the brain than previously thought.

Introduction
==============
Extracellular field potentials (EFPs) are at the heart of many experimental
approaches used to examine the inner workings of the brain.  These are
invasively recorded signals such as the electrocorticogram (ECoG), the local field
potential (LFP), the current source density (CSD), and the multiunit activity (MUA) as
well as the noninvasively recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) and the auditory
brainstem response (ABR) [@Brette2012Handbook; @Nunez2006Electric]. The origins
of these signals, especially in cases in which the activity is not clearly
attributable to a single cell, is a matter of debate [@Buzsaki2012Origin].

EFPs in the brain were long thought to be primarily of synaptic origin
[@Buzsaki2012Origin]. As a consequence, many modeling studies focussed on the
extracellular fields induced by postsynaptic currents on the dendrites and the soma
of a neuron [@Gold2006Origin; @Holt1999Electrical;
@Einevoll2013Modelling; @Linden2011Modeling; @Linden2010Intrinsic;
@FernandezRuiz2013Cytoarchitectonic]. However, a number of recent data analyses
and modeling efforts have revealed that active, non-synaptic membrane currents
can play an important role in generating EFPs [@Reimann2013Biophysically;
@Anastassiou2015Cell; @Schomburg2012Spiking; @Ray2011Different;
@Belluscio2012CrossFrequency], including far reaching potentials detectable at
the scalp [@Telenczuk2011Highfrequency; @Telenczuk2015Correlates]. However,
currents from the axon are still thought to be so small as to be of minor
importance for the EFP.

One of the reasons for the assumption that axonal currents contribute little to
the EFP is that the far field of an action potential traveling along an
idealized straight axon is quadrupolar, meaning that it decays faster with
distance than synaptic sources, which are typically dipolar
[@Nunez2006Electric]. However, in experimental studies that recorded the EFP of
axonal responses, the EFP can also have a dipolar structure. For example,
@Blot2014Ultrarapid recorded from the vicinity of cerebellar Purkinje cell
axons and reported an EFP with a characteristic dipolar structure.
@Swadlow2002Activation showed that the axonal part of the EFP of
thalamocortical afferents showed a polarity reversal as associated with a
dipolar source. Classical current source density studies found dipolar current
distributions in axonal terminal zones in the cortex and lateral geniculate
nucleus, and attributed these to axons by means of conduction velocity
estimation [@Mitzdorf1985Current]. Here we we present a
further well developed example of a dipolar, axonal field potential from the auditory
brainstem of the barn owl.

This discrepancy between the quadrupolar structure of EFPs generated by
idealized axons, as predicted by theory, and the experimentally observed
dipolar structure, raises the question of how axons are able to generate
dipolar field potentials. We show how dipolar far fields in the EFP of axons
can be explained by the axons' anatomical structure. In particular, we show
that the branchings and terminations of axons in their terminal zone area lead
to a dipolar EFP structure. Such axon bundles, often also called 
fascicles, exist throughout the peripheral and central nervous system [@kandel2000principles; @Hentschel1999Models; @Nornes1972Temporal;
@Goodman1984Cell]. The white matter of the mammalian brain can be viewed as an
agglomeration of such bundles [@Schuz2002Human]. We therefore predict
pronounced contributions of nerves or fascicles to EFPs, which are neglected in
almost all current models.

In what follows, properties of the EFP due to axonal projections are first
investigated by a numerical model based on forward simulation
[@Holt1999Electrical; @Gold2006Origin]. This first model includes a large-scale
multicompartment model of an axon population. We then outline the mechanisms
underlying the observed effects by means of a second, analytically tractable,
model of a generic axon bundle. Finally, we show a concrete example of the
effects in experimental data using as a set of multi-site in-vivo
electrophysiological recordings from the barn owl brain stem.

Results
==============

Effects of axonal bifurcations and terminations on extracellular action potentials
----

To understand how the geometry of an axon affects the extracellular waveform
associated with action potentials, we numerically simulated single action
potentials propagating along generic axons and calculated their contribution to
the EFP along the axon. We began by simulating an
infinitely long axon following a straight line path, neither bifurcating nor
terminating ([@fig:simpletree]A). The extracellular action potential has the
characteristic triphasic shape. As the action potential travels from top to
bottom, the waveform is translated in time with the conduction velocity, but is
otherwise unchanged.

There are two ways of understanding the triphasic shape of the extracellular
waveform. The first is by attribution of the peaks of the response to
individual current types. The first, positive peak corresponds to the capacitive
current, the large second peak to the sodium current, and the final peak to the
potassium current [@Gold2006Origin]. A second, more mathematical approach is specific to the
nature of the axon. Due to Kirchoff's law and cable theory (see Methods), the local
transmembrane current in an axon is proportional to the second spatial derivative
of the membrane potential along the direction of the axon. Because the action
potential is roughly a travelling wave, the currents are also proportional to
the second *temporal* derivative of the membrane potential. The three extrema of the EFP
are thus related to the points of maximum curvature in the action potential
waveform, namely the onset, the maximum, and the end of the spike.

Next we simulated the response of an axon that terminates ([@fig:simpletree]B).
Here the approaching action potential (top traces) has the same, triphasic
shape as in the non-branching case. When the action potential reaches the
termination point, it gradually deforms into a biphasic response, with a
positive peak preceding a negative peak. The mechanism for this deformation can
be understood as follows: As the action potential approaches the recording
location next to the termination, the majority of the currents flow at points
located before the termination, and are identical to those in the
non-terminating case; the first peak is not affected. The second and third peak
of the extracellular action potential in the non-terminating case are generated
by currents close to or after the electrode location. In the terminating
axon, the currents at points after the termination are no longer present,
leading to a partial suppression of the second peak and a complete suppression
of the third peak at locations after the termination.

Another generic structure found in axons is a bifurcation. We simulated a single axon
that bifurcates three times on each branch within a distance of 50 $\mu$m,
leading to a total number of 8 fibers leaving the bifurcation zone
([@fig:simpletree]C). The EFP near this bifurcation zone also has a biphasic
shape. Although there is an initial small positive peak, the response is
dominated by the second, negative and the third, positive peak. This waveform
can again be understood by comparison to the first example containing the
infinitely long axon: The initial peak resembles the infinite case, because
most of the action potential-related currents are flowing within the part of
the axon before the bifurcation. As the action potential passes the bifurcation
zone, it multiplies and there are now several action potentials (one in each
fiber). Because of the active nature of the action potential, the currents are also multiplied and sum up across the fibers. This leads the second and
third peak to be multiplied in size, yielding a more biphasic response. We
chose to simulate several bifurcations because this leads to a clearer effect
in the EFP. In the case of a single bifurcation, this effect is also present,
but the amplification of the second and third peak relative to the first peak
is not as notable as in this example.

To understand how bifurcations and terminations interact when they are present
in the same axon, we simulated an axon with an identical number of bifurcations
as in the previous case, but then added terminations to all the fibers 200
$\mu$m after the bifurcation zone ([@fig:simpletree]D). We found that this
configuration leads to the same biphasic responses as observed in the
cases of the isolated anatomical features. A triphasic response
occurred in-between the bifurcation and termination zones. A notable point here is that the
potential at the bifurcation and termination are both biphasic and on the same
timescale, but opposite in polarity. 

Moving towards more biologically plausible axon geometries, we next considered
a population of axons with slightly altered characteristics. The basic
structure for each axon in the population was the same as in
[@fig:simpletree]D, but we randomly perturbed the precise locations of
bifurcations and terminations in the axon tree ([@fig:simpletree]E, left). We
furthermore stimulated each axon with an inhomogeneous Poisson spike train. The
driving rate of the inhomogeneous Poisson process was the same for all axons
and was consisted of a constant background rate and a Gaussian pulse of
heightened activity. The resulting extracellular waveforms ([@fig:simpletree]E,
right) showed a polarity reversal similar to that seen in the single action potential and axon
EFP ([@fig:simpletree]D). In contrast to the single-spike and single-axon case, the potential at
the center of the terminal zone largely cancelled out because the differences
in spike timing across fibers.

The reversal behaviour is similar to the polarity reversal associated with a
dipole observed in experimental studies (@Swadlow2002Activation;
@Blot2014Ultrarapid; this study). We have shown that simple model axon
structures can produce complex and diverse spatiotemporal responses comparable
to some experimental responses.

Axonal projections generate a dipole-like field potential
-----

To understand how axons can generate a dipolar EFP, we simulated a
parallel fiber bundle that at first runs at constant diameter without
bifurcations and then reaches a terminal zone. Within this projection zone,
the fibers first bifurcate, which increases the number of fibers. Finally, the
axons reach a termination zone, in which the number of fibers decreases to zero
([@fig:bigtree]A). To model more closely the actual axonal structures found in
nature, we also extended the model axons to include a radial fanning out of the
branches, as well as a more diverse set of morphologies including a variable
number of bifurcations and terminations.

The spiking activity of a generic axon bundle was simulated by stimulating
fibers that had a background spontaneous firing rate of 100 spikes/second with
a pulse of increased activity. We chose a Gaussian pulse with an amplitude of
2900 spikes/second and a standard deviation of 2.8 ms. These numbers are
motivated by the early auditory system
[@koppl97a;@Sullivan1984Segregation;@Konishi1985Owls]. However, we do not model
the phase locking which is specific to the auditory system, so this pulse of
activity could relate to any kind of evoked activity in the nervous system,
such as a sensory stimulation, motor activity or a spontaneous transient
increase in population spiking activity.

To characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the evoked EFP, the time course
of the potential was calculated for several locations along the axon trunk. We
divided our analysis into 2 frequency bands by filtering the responses. These
frequency components are sometimes referred to as the LFP and the MUA (see Methods).

Because we first wanted to study the effect of the rate pulse on the EFP, we
low-pass filtered the EFP responses with a cut-off frequency of 1 kHz
([@fig:bigtree]B). This removed most of the contributions of individual spikes,
while the population-level signal remained. The distribution of maximum
amplitudes of these responses are shown by the  colored contour lines in
[@fig:bigtree]A and the colored voltage traces in [@fig:bigtree]B. Surrounding
the terminal zone of the axon bundle, amplitudes showed the double-lobed
shape typical of a dipole.

In [@fig:bigtree]B, all the responses showed a biphasic or monophasic
deflection that was elicited by the population firing rate pulse. This
deflection was visible at all recording locations. The deflection reverses
polarity in the middle of the terminal zone of the bundle ([@fig:bigtree]B).
The polarity reversal occurs by a decrease of the amplitude to zero and a
subsequent reappearance with reversed polarity, as opposed to a polarity
reversal through a gradual shift in phase. This behaviour is also typical for a
dipolar field potential.

The point of the polarity reversal coincides roughly with the middle of the
terminal zone. This means that the absolute value of the response amplitude
reaches a local minimum just when the number of axonal fibers reaches a
maximum. To better understand how anatomical features and response amplitude
are related, we compared the signed maximum value (meaning the *signed* value
corresponding to the maximum *absolute* amplitude) of the EFP (black line in
[@fig:bigtree]C) with the difference in the number of branchings and
terminations (blue histogram in [@fig:bigtree]C).

Along the nerve trunk the number of fibers is constant. As the axon bundle reaches
its terminal zone, the number of bifurcations increases. The increase of
bifurcations is followed by an increase of terminations. In the middle of the
terminal zone, the number of bifurcations and terminations are equal. At
the same depth, the amplitude of the low-frequency component crosses zero.  At
the end of the terminal zone, the terminations outweigh the bifurcations. As
the axon bundle ends, there are no longer any bifurcations or terminations, and
the number of fibers decays toward zero. Overall, the amplitude of the maximum response
(black trace) follows the distribution of branchings and terminations (blue
histogram). 

The progression of amplitudes in the low-frequency components seen in
[@fig:bigtree]C is also visible in [@fig:bigtree]B, most clearly in the first
column. The polarity reversal in the center of [@fig:bigtree]B corresponds to
the crossing of zero amplitude in figure [@fig:bigtree]C.

<!--To better understand the relationship between axonal anatomy and this spatial
structure of the EFP, we plotted the change in density of the bundle, meaning
the number of terminations subtracted from the number of bifurcations at a
given 

The low-frequency component shows a distinct relationship to the anatomy: it
appears to be governed by the local density of bifurcations and terminations.
Along the nerve trunk the fiber density is constant, and the low frequency
component is unchanged. As the axon bundle reaches its projection zone, the
number of bifurcations increases, and the low frequency component increases in
amplitude. In the middle of the projection zone, the number of bifurcations and
terminations cancels out.  Correspondingly, the low-frequency component
amplitude reaches a local minimum.  As the end of the projection zone
approaches, the terminations outweigh the bifurcations, and the amplitude
increases, but the polarity is reversed (red box in [@fig:bigtree]B). As the
axon bundle ends, there are no longer any bifurcations or terminations, and the
amplitude decays.

The same distribution of maximum amplitudes for the high-frequency component,
shown in [@fig:bigtree]D, did not show the same lobed shape. Instead it decayed
much faster with distance in both axial and radial direction. This was also
reflected in the waveforms (Fig 1E). There is an increase in amplitude due to
the firing rate pulse at locations close to the nerve bundle, but at locations
further away from the trunk it is no longer distinguishable from the background
activity.-->

To understand the contributions related to individual spikes, we next turned
our attention to the high-frequency range. We calculated the MUA of the
response, which contains the high-frequency (>1 kHz) components, and is thought
to reflect spiking activity in extracellular recordings. The MUA did not show a
double-lobe, but rather appeared like an ellipsoid centered at the terminal zone
([@fig:bigtree]D).

The shape of the MUA response was not modulated heavily in space, the main
change across locations lies in the scaling of the amplitude ([@fig:bigtree]E).
The amplitude decays with radial distance from the trunk. The amplitude reaches
its maximum at the middle of the fiber bundle.

The longitudinal behaviour is further examined in [@fig:bigtree]F. The
amplitude of the MUA component (red trace) changes its amplitude in the
longitudinal direction in accordance to the local number of fibers (black
histogram). It has an approximately constant amplitude along the nerve trunk
and then increases in amplitude as the number of fibers is increased by
bifurcations. As the fibers terminate and the number of fibers decreases, so does the
amplitude of the MUA.

We have thus shown a qualitatively different behaviour in the low- and
high-frequency components of the EFP. Both appear to be related to anatomy,
though each in a different way. Together, these relationships suggest that the
particular branching and terminating structure of the axon bundle may give rise to
a dipolar field potential.

Effects of bifurcations and terminations on distance scaling behaviour of EFPs
--------

Because dipolar fields are associated with a longer spatial reach than the
quadrupolar fields typically associated with axonal spikes, we decided to
investigate the effect of axon structure on the spatial reach of the
frequency components ([@fig:distscaling]). To do this we performed a further
simulation of an axon bundle. In this case we simulated two versions of the
axon bundle, one containing a terminal zone with bifurcations, and one
without bifurcations in which a fixed number of fibers arrives and then
terminates.

To avoid confounding effects in the spatial reach of the potentials due to the
arrangement of axon branches, and afford better analytic tractability, we
transitioned to a simplified model of the axon bundle. This model omitted the
radial fanning out of the bundle in the terminal zone used in the simulation
of [@fig:bigtree]. Furthermore, the simplified model discarded the detailed
conductance-based simulation of the membrane potential, and instead assumed a
given membrane potential travelling along the axon trunk with constant
propagation velocity. Using linear cable theory, it was then possible to
calculate the membrane currents necessary for determination of the EFP. The
simplified model also allowed us to consider a continuous number of fibers instead
of simulating discrete bifurcations and bifurcations. While highly simplified,
this model captures all effects described for the more complex model so far.
All following simulations are based on this simplified model.

The dipole-like component observed in [@fig:bigtree] had it's dipole axis
aligned with the axon trunk. We therefore expected the field potential to decay
as $r^{-2}$ in this direction, which we call the axial direction. To test
this, we plotted the amplitude of the low-frequency component (<1 kHz) in axial
direction in [@fig:distscaling]A. The plot is on a double logarithmic scale,
meaning that the slope of the curve corresponds to the scaling exponent, and
the vertical offset corresponds to the amplitude of the component. We observe
$r^{-2}$ scaling for distances larger than the extent of the
bifurcation zone ($\approx 1$ mm), but the amplitude of the low-frequency
component remains an order of magnitude larger in the bifurcating case (solid
line) than in the non-bifurcating case (dashed line). Next we examined the
high-frequency component ([@fig:distscaling]B). Here the asymptotic scaling is
also $r^{-2}$ for distances $\gtrsim 1$ mm, but the amplitudes are similar between bifurcating and non-bifurcating case .
The difference between the amplitudes of bifurcating and non-bifurcating
bundles is much smaller than in the low-frequency case, even though the
difference in amplitudes are the same at short distances $\lesssim 100 \mu$m.
At these distances, the difference is proportional to the number of fibers,
which is larger in the bifurcating case. To conclude, the terminal zone
contributes mainly to the low-frequency dipole moment of the EFP.

In contrast to the axial direction, the dipole hypothesis predicts a different
scaling behaviour of the EFP for the radial direction. The dipole component
becomes zero in the direction perpendicular to the dipole axis, and we thus
expected quadrupolar or higher-order scaling behaviour in this case. In
[@fig:distscaling]C we can see that this is indeed the case for the
low-frequency component. The potentials scale as $r^{-3}$ and the difference in
logarithmic amplitude between bifurcating and non-bifurcating case is roughly
the same at all distances. The high-frequency component also decayed as
$r^{-3}$ in the radial direction ([@fig:distscaling]D), and the difference in
amplitudes was slightly diminished at larger distances.

To better understand the frequency-specific contributions to the dipole
moments, we calculated the scaling behaviour as a function of frequency. The
amplitude of the dipole moment was determined by fitting a straight line with
slope $-2$ to the double logarithmic scaling of the power spectral density. The
power spectral density was averaged over a frequency band 500 Hz wide, and the
fit was performed for distances $> 1$ mm. The y-intecept of this straight line
then gave the dipole moments. Frequency-specific dipole moments are shown in
[@fig:distscaling]E. We can see that the dipole moment in the bifurcating case
(solid line) exceeds the non-bifurcating case (dashed line) for low
frequencies. The dipole moment of the bifurcating case has a maximum at around
1 kHz, while in the non-bifurcating case it decays monotonically. For higher
frequencies, the moments become roughly equal.

We thus conclude that the dipolar component will dominate the EFP at long
distances in all directions except for those perpendicular to the dipole axis.
At shorter distances, and in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis, the
quadrupolar component becomes important (as in any multipole expansion). For
this reason we performed the same analysis for the quadrupole moments
([@fig:distscaling]F). Here the moments are similar for low frequencies below 500 Hz,
then diverge at frequencies up to 2 kHz, before approaching each other again
for frequencies above 2 kHz. The quadrupole moment of the bifurcating case has a
maximum at around 2kHz.

In [@fig:distscaling]G we compare the relative impact of the terminal zone on
dipole (red line) and quadrupole moments (black line), by plotting their ratios
of across frequencies. Here we can see that for low frequencies, the ratio for
the quadrupole moment approaches unity, meaning that there is no additional
contribution from the terminal zone. The dipole moment approaches a factor of
10, meaning that the terminal zone contributes. In both components, the
contribution is maximal for intermediate frequencies, with the maximal dipolar
contribution lying at lower frequencies than the quadrupolar component. For
very high frequencies, both contributions return to values below 5. The
terminal zone has a supralinear contribution (factor greater than 10) for the
dipole at frequencies below 3.5 kHz and for the quadrupolar component at
frequencies between 1 and 4.5 kHz.

Together, these observations show us that the terminal zone makes a strong
contribution to the far-reaching dipole field potential of the axon bundle. At
higher frequencies, the more local quadrupolar potential is also affected.

The barn owl neurophonic potential in nucleus laminaris as an example for a dipolar field in an axonal terminal zone.
----

In order to test our model of the extracellular field of axon bundles, we
compared it to recordings from the barn owl auditory brain stem.

The barn owl has a highly developed auditory system with a strong frequency
following response in the EFP recorded in the nucleus laminaris (NL), called
the neurophonic. In NL, the input from the two ears is first integrated to
calculate the azimuthal location of a sound source, and this information is
encoded in the EFP. The EFP in this region is mainly due to the efferent axons
and synaptic currents, and the spiking contribution of postsynaptic neurons is
minimal [@Kuokkanen2010Origin]. Furthermore, the anatomy of the efferent axons
is well known and follows a stereotypical pattern [@carr90]: Two fiber bundles
enter the nucleus, with fibers from the contralateral ear entering ventrally,
and from the ipsilateral ear entering dorsally. The axon bundles reach the
nucleus from the previous nucleus without bifurcating, then bifrucate multiple
times at the border of the NL, and then terminate within NL. They have a strong
directional preference and run roughly in parallel. This well studied
physiology and anatomy makes the system an ideal candidate to study the EFPs of
axon bundles.

To study the spatiotemporal structure of the EFP in NL, we performed
simultaneous recordings of the response in NL to contralateral monaural click
stimuli. The click responses showed a distinct high- and low-frequency
component as previously reported [@wagner09]. The high-frequency ringing
corresponds to the position on the frequency map within NL being recorded from
and reflects the tuning of the axons to the stimulus frequency. We filtered the
data to roughly separate these components. The cutoff to split the components
was set to 2 kHz, because this frequency was always well below
the high-frequency ringing component, which usually dominated the spectra.

The model was fit to the data by performing a nonlinear least squares
optimization. Free parameters were (1) the number of fibers at the depth of each recording
location, (2) the average membrane potential over time in a single fiber at the
location next to the most dorsal electrode, (3) the conduction velocity and (4)
the distance between bundle and electrode array.

![ Spatial structure of EFPs recorded from the barn owl can be explained by

The resulting EFP responses and the model fit are shown in [@fig:barnowl]A.
[@fig:barnowl]A shows the high-frequency ($\geq 2$ kHz) response. The orange
lines show the actual responses in the data. The responses are have a
Gabor-like shape, as expected [@wagner09], and have their maximal amplitude in
the center of the recording array, at around $850 \mu$m recording depth. The
velocity was calculated to be 4.0 m/s. A previously published estimate of the
axonal conduction velocity in this nucleus was 1.6 m/s in
@McColgan2014Functional. Toward the edges, the amplitude decays. In the
central region, a systematic shift in delay can be observed, while the response
seems to be stationary in the more dorsal and ventral electrodes. The delay
increases from ventral to dorsal, which is consistent with the anatomy for
contralateral stimulation. All these aspects are qualitatively reproduced by
the model (purple traces). The main deviation between model and data lies in a
slightly diminished amplitude of the oscillation at the most central electrode
sites. Because the phase shift in the central region is mainly determined by
the conduction velocity, this might be due to a
slightly changing conduction velocity in the nucleus. A diminished amplitude in
the model fit could reflect an inability to exactly match the phase
progression. Another possible explanation is that the additional amplitude
could be due to non-axonal sources such as postsynaptic spikes, which do not
follow the assumptions underlying the model being fit.

The low-frequency ($30$ Hz - $2$ kHz, [@fig:barnowl]B) responses reveal
the typical polarity reversal observed in earlier figures. The
responses at the dorsal and ventral edges show the same shape, but with opposite
polarity. The central responses show a diminished maximum amplitude,
but not a total cancellation of the response (as expected for a pure dipole).
This is due to the contribution of the more local quadrupole component at this
location relatively close to the activated fibers. The model is able to capture
the behaviour of this component as well, with a slight underestimation of the
amplitude of the peak at ventral locations. The model also captures but
underestimates a small oscillation in the data with period of $\approx 1$ ms in
the center of the recording. Here, too, the deviations might be due to a
slightly inhomogenous conduction velocity or non-axonal sources.

[@fig:barnowl]C shows the inferred average over trials of the membrane voltage
in response to the stimulus, at a location in the axon next to the first
electrode. It is composed of high and low-frequency components similar to those
observed in the EFP. When comparing this inferred membrane potential response
to the measured EFP response, the most salient difference is that in the EFP,
the low-frequency component has a comparable amplitude to the high-frequency
component, but in the membrane voltage the low-frequency component is much
larger. This is due to the fact that the second derivative term in the current
equation essentially imposes a high-pass filter on the membrane voltage.

The inferred number of fibers is shown in [@fig:barnowl]D. The density (number
of fibers per unit length) is shown as a function of dorsoventral depth,
meaning that the y-axis of [@fig:barnowl]A and [@fig:barnowl]B corresponds to
the x-axis in [@fig:barnowl]D. The density has its maximum at the center of the
electrode array, and decays steadily to both sides. This profile of the number of fibers
is consistent with the known anatomy of axons in NL. The density does not decay
to zero on either side, which may be due to the limited range of recording
locations. The number of fibers beyond the border of the nucleus in dorsal
direction should be zero, because it is known from anatomy that all fibers
terminate within the nucleus.

Discussion
==============
Based on numerical simulations, analytical calculations and experimental data,
we show that axonal fiber bundles can contribute significantly to the EFP, and
how the contributions are shaped by axonal morphology. We characterize three
principal effects of axon bundle structure on the EFP. Firstly, the
low-frequency components of the EFP are governed by the densities of
bifurcations and terminations and can have a dipolar
structure ([@fig:simpletree] and [@fig:bigtree]). Secondly, the high-frequency
components are governed by the local number of fibers ([@fig:bigtree]).
Furthermore we show that the low-frequency components exceed the high-frequency
components in spatial reach. In particular, the dipolar low-frequency
components are not negligible and exceed the reach of the presumed quadrupolar
nature of axonal EFPs ([@fig:distscaling]).

Relevance to interpretation of electrophysiological recordings
----

The two frequency components show qualitatively different behaviour across
recording locations. The low-frequency component is a largely stationary
phenomenon, while the high-frequency component shifts in space as a function of
the axonal conduction velocity ([@fig:barnowl]). Due to the difference in reach,
the high-frequency component is most suitable for the
study of local phenomena, while the low-frequency component bears information
about locations more distant from the recording site ([@fig:distscaling]).

These findings relate to the interpretation of a wide range of
electrophysiological data. Heuristics which are valid for the analysis of EFPs
of synaptic, dendritic, or somatic currents may not be valid for axon bundles.
When performing a typical current source density analysis, the local number of
fibers cannot be disentangled from membrane current density
[@Nicholson1973Theoretical]. The membrane voltage, and thus the
membrane current densities, may vary with time and location independently. In
the case of an axonal fiber bundle as discussed here, the opposite is the case:
the number of fibers is variable in space, in particular in the terminal zone,
but the membrane voltages are highly correlated over space and time. The sink
and source distribution found in classical CSD analysis of axon bundles
[@Mitzdorf1978Prominent;@Mitzdorf1985Current;@Mitzdorf1977Laminar], show a
dipolar structure in terminal zones. Our modelling approach provides a novel
way of interpreting these findings.

Dipolar fields also play an important role in the generation of electrical
field potentials at greater distances from the brain. The most prominent of
these is the EEG, which is commonly attributed to the dipolar contributions of
pyramidal cells [@Nunez2006Electric]. We propose that axonal contributions might also be
relevant in the analysis of these fields. This is particularly true for the
auditory brainstem response, which is closely related to the EEG and involves
brain structures that display high degrees of synchrony as well as 
axonal organization, and are thus ideal candidates for
the generation of axonal field potentials visible at long ranges. This would in
turn have implications for the interpretation of the ABR in clinical contexts.

Dipolar EFPs in other animals and brain regions
----

It is interesting to note that a similar dipole-like reversal of polarity as
shown here for the barn owl NL has been reported in the chicken NL
[@Schwarz1992Can], as well as in the mammalian analog to NL, the medial
superior olive [@McLaughlin2010Oscillatory]. The phase reversal in this case has
been successfully modeled based on the assumption that the postsynaptic NL and
MSO dendrites with their bipolar morphology have a dipolar EFP response
[@McLaughlin2010Oscillatory; @Goldwyn2014Model]. However, in the owl this dipolar
morphology is largely absent [@carr90], making dendritic sources unlikely. This
suggests that similar dipolar field potentials in owls and mammals emerge from
different physiological substrates. Such a convergence might point towards an
evolutionary pressure favouring such an EFP structure in coincidence detection
systems, and indeed @Goldwyn2016Neuronal have proposed a model in which this
potential enhances the function of coincidence detectors through a form of
ephaptic interaction. Their approach centers on dendrites and is not directly
transferable, but it seems possible that a similar mechanism might arise in the
barn owl NL based on axonal EFPs.

One assumption underlying our modelling of axonal geometries is that there
exists a preferential direction of growth of the axon arbor. In many structures
this is the case, for example in the parts of the auditory brainstem we studied
here. In other brain regions, this tendency is not as prominent, with a
spectrum existing between completely directed and undirected growth. More
undirected growth would lead to a more diffuse response in the EFP, and
eventually to a cancellation of the dipolar field potentials. @Cuntz2010One and
@Budd2010Neocortical studied the principles underlying the growth patterns of
axons and found that the degree of direction in the growth of an axon depends
on the balance struck between conduction delay and wiring cost. Optimizing for
minimal conduction time leads to highly directed structures, while optimizing
wiring cost leads to more tortuous, undirected growth. This leads to the
conclusion that directed structures and thus also strong, dipolar EFPs due to
axons will be more prevalent in systems which require high temporal precision.

Conclusion
----

In conclusion, axonal projections can contribute substantially to EFPs. The
analysis of the responses can provide insight into both the underlying anatomy
as well as the activity. Future studies of axonal EFPs might provide insights
into the temporal and spatial structure of efferent activity in many brain
regions.

Methods
==============

Experimental recordings
-----------------------

The experiments were conducted at the Department of Biology of the University
Maryland. Data was collected from three barn owls (*Tyto furcata pratincola*).
Procedures conformed to NIH Guidelines for Animal Research and were approved by
the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland. Anaesthesia
was induced prior to each experiment by intramuscular injection of a total of
$8-10$ ml/kg of $20\%$ urethane divided into three to four injections over the
course of $3$ hours. Body temperature was maintained at $39^\circ$C by a
feedback-controlled heating blanket.

Recordings were made in a sound-attenuating chamber (Acoustic Systems Inc.,
Austin, TX, USA). Tungsten electrodes with impedances between $2$ and $20$
M$\Omega$ were used to find suitable recording locations in NL. Once NL had
been located, the electrode was retracted and replaced with a 32 channel
multi-electrode array (A1x32-15mm-50-413-A32, Neuronexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
The multi-electrode array was lowered using a microdrive (MP225, Sutter
Instruments Co., Novato, CA, USA) during continuous presentation of a
white-noise burst stimulus until visual inspection of the waveform showed that
NL was at the center of the array. A grounded silver chloride pellet, placed
under the animal's skin around the incision, served as the reference electrode.
Electrode signals were amplified by a headstage (HS36, Neuralynx Inc., Tucson,
AZ, USA). An adapter (ADPT-HS36-N2T-32A, Neuralynx Inc.) was used between the
electrode and the headstage. A further adapter (ADPT-HS-36-ERP-27, Neuralynx
Inc.) was used between HS36 and the control panel in order to map all 32
channels to the amplifiers. Pre-amplified electrode signals were passed to the
control panel (ERP27, Neuralynx Inc.), then to four 8-channel amplifiers
(Lynx-8, Neuralynx Inc.), and then to an analogue-to-digital converter (Cheetah
Digital Interface, Neuralynx Inc.) connected to a personal computer running
Cheetah5 software (Neuralynx Inc.) where the responses were stored for off-line
analysis.

Acoustic stimuli were digitally generated by a custom-made \textsc{Matlab}
(MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) script driving a signal-processing board (RX6,
Tucker-Davis Techonologies) at a sampling rate of 195.3125 kHz. The sound stimuli
were attenuated using a programmable attenuator (PA5, Tucker-Davis
Techonologies, Alachua, FL, USA). Click stimuli were generated as a single
half-wave of a 5 kHz sine tone. Miniature earphones were inserted into the
owl's ear canals and fixed to the headplate. Acoustic stimuli were fed to these
earphones. Stimulus delivery was triggered by National Instruments equipment
(NI USB-6259 and BNC-2090A, National Instruments Inc, Austin, TX, USA), and
stimulus presentation times were recorded along with the responses. Trigger
pulses are configured in \textsc{MatLab} through Ephus software (Vidrio
Technologies LLC, Ashburn, VA, USA).

Numerical model
---------------------

We modeled axons using NEURON [@Hines1997NEURON; @Hines2009NEURON] and extended
previous work by @Kuba2009Roles, which included the high and low
threshold potassium channels used by @Rathouz1998Characterization. The axon was
modeled as a sequence of active nodes and passive myelinated segments. Unlike
previous models, we included branching axons in our simulations. These were
generated by connecting two passive segments to a node, and continuing the
alternation of active and passive segment in each resulting branch. The
myelinated segments and nodes had lengths of 75 $\mu$m and 2 $\mu$m,
respectively. In cases where the positions of the bifurcations or terminations
were fixed, the last segment was shortened in order to obtain the total length
before the next bifurcation or termination.

At the designated spike times, a special conductance was temporarily activated
in the first node of Ranvier, causing the axon to fire. The conductance had a reversal
potential of 0 mV, a maximal amplitude of 0.05 $\mu$S, and a timecourse
described by an alpha-function with time constant 0.01 ms. Soma and axon
initial segment were not modeled explicitly. 

For the simplified axon geometries used in [@fig:simpletree], the branching
pattern was fixed as described in the caption, with the exception of
the axial position of the branching points in [@fig:simpletree]E, where a random
offset between branching points was drawn from a gamma distribution with mean
400 $\mu$m and standard deviation 300 $\mu$m. The initial branching point was
offset from the original location by a distance drawn from a
Gaussian distribution with mean zero and a standard deviation of 300 $\mu$m.

For the axon populations in [@fig:bigtree], branching patterns were generated
procedurally, starting with a root segment. In order to avoid artifacts from
the stimulus and to simulate a fiber tract prior to the terminal zone, a
sequence of 10 active and passive segments without bifurcations was assumed
before the terminal zone. To this root, segments were appended iteratively.
Before adding a segment, a decision whether to branch or terminate an axon was
drawn from a probability distribution dependent on the axial position of the
end of the previous segment. These probability distributions were modeled as
logistic functions with the parameters adjusted to roughly match the numbers of
branchings and terminations found in the tracings shown in publications such as
@carr90. Thus, an initial phase dominated by bifurcations was followed by a
phase dominated by terminations, with the probability of termination reaching 100\% at
the end of the terminal zone. The distribution of bifurcations had it's
maximum at location $z=0$ and a standard deviation of 200 $\mu$m, and the
terminations at $z=500$ $\mu$m, with a standard deviation of 100 $\mu$m. The
branching angle had an average of $20^\circ$, with a standard deviation of
$5^\circ$. At branching points, the plane containing the branches had a random
orientation, resulting in a 3-dimensional structure of the axon bundle.

Numerical simulations of action potentials propagating along these axons
yielded the membrane currents, from which we calculated the extracellular
fields. This procedure is described in detail by @Gold2006Origin, among others.
Briefly, the extracellular medium is assumed to be a homogeneous volume
conductor with conductivity $\sigma_e$, and a quasi-static approximation of the
electrical field potential $\phi$ is made. The extracellular potential
$\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$ at location $\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$ due to a current
distribution $I(\mathbf{r},t)$ is then governed by the equation $\Delta
\phi(\mathbf{r},t) = \frac{1}{\sigma_e} I(\mathbf{r},t)$, with $\Delta$
denoting the Laplace operator. If the currents $I$ are constrained to a volume
$W$, this equation has the solution: \begin{equation}
\phi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{W}\frac{I(\mathbf{r}',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}\textrm{d}\mathbf{r}'
\label{eqn:basic} \end{equation} Since the majority of the current flows
through the small nondes of Ranvier, we used the point source approximation; we
did not use the line source approximation [@Holt1999Electrical].

All filtering was performed with third order Butterworth filters. The MUA was
calculated by high-pass filtering the signal with a cutoff of 2500 Hz, setting
all samples with negative values to zero, and then low-pass filtering the
resulting response with a cutoff of 500 Hz. The LFP was calculated by low-pass filtering the signal with a cutoff of 1000 Hz.

Simplified axon-bundle model
----------------------------

\label{sec:efpresp}

To better understand the processes leading to the dipolar EFP responses, we
devised an analytically tractable model of the responses. We defined the
spatial dimension in cylindrical coordinates $\mathbf{r}=(\rho,\varphi,z)$, and
we considered a simple model axon bundle that extended infinitely in $z$
direction at $\rho=0$. The bundle had a variable number of fibers along the $z$
axis, denoted by $n(z)$. We assumed the axons to be perfect transmission lines,
meaning that the action potential acts like a travelling wave with velocity $v$
along the axon. In particular, we neglected any delays and distortions that can be induced when
an axon branches or terminates. 

In this case, the membrane voltage was the same in each fiber for a given $z$
coordinate. From linear cable theory [e.g. @Jack75Electric], we then obtained
the following expression for the total transmembrane current $I(z,t)$ from a
given membrane potential $V(z,t)$:
\begin{align}
I(z,t)& = \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left(n(z)\frac{\partial }{\partial z}V(z,t)\right)\\
&= \frac{\partial n}{\partial z}(z)\cdot\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}(z,t)+n(z)\cdot\frac{\partial ^2V}{\partial z^2}(z,t) 
\end{align}
<!--
\\
&= \frac{\partial n}{\partial z}(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v}\frac{\partial V}{\partial
t}(z,t)+n(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial ^2V}{\partial t^2}(z,t)

from which, together with the fact that the axial conductivity is proportional
to the number of fibers $g_{tot}=ng$ we can then derive the membrane currents
flowing at a given location:

\begin{align}
I(z,t)& = \frac{d}{dz}\left(n(z)\frac{d}{dz}V(z,t)\right)\\
&= \frac{dn}{dz}(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v}\frac{dV}{dt}(z,t)-n(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{d^2V}{dt^2}(z,t)
\end{align}
-->
Applying this membrane current to equation (\ref{eqn:basic}) we
calculated the corresponding extracellular field potential $\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$
of a given $V$ propagating through such an axon bundle. Due to the rotational
symmetry of the system, and the fact that current flows only at $\rho = 0$,
it is

\begin{align}
    \phi(\mathbf{r},t) =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{I(z',t)}{\sqrt{(z-z')^2 + \rho^2}}\textrm{d}z'
\end{align}

<!--
&=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\frac{dn}{dz}(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v}\frac{dV}{dt}(z,t)-n(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{d^2V}{dt^2}(z,t)}{\sqrt{(z-z')^2 + \rho^2}}\textrm{d}z'

Equation \ref{eqn:infkern} has the form of a convolution with a weighting
function $w$: \begin{equation} w(\rho,z) =
\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_e}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+\rho^2}} \label{eqn:weighting}
\end{equation}

The convolution can then be written as:

\begin{equation} \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) =
\left[I(z,t)\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z \end{equation}

with the operator $\left[\cdot\ast\cdot\right]_z$ denoting the convolution with
respect to the variable $z$.
-->

Model fitting to experimental data
----------------------------

In order to relate the model to experimentally obtained data, we performed a
nonlinear least squares fit, minimizing the mean squared error $\epsilon$
between the measured potential $\phi_\text{measured}$ and the model prediction
$\phi_\text{model}$ for $N = 32$ measurement locations $z_n$ and $M = 600$ timepoints
$t_m$: $\epsilon =
\frac{1}{NM}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}\left[\phi_\text{measured}(z_n,t_m)-\phi_\text{model}(z_n,t_m)\right]^2$.
We achieved this minimization using the "optimize.minimize" routine provided by the
\textsc{SciPy} package [@scipy]. The free parameters to be determined by the
optimization routine were the distance $\rho$, the conduction velocity $v$, the
number of fibers per unit lenght $n(z_n)$ for each measurement location, and the membrane voltage
at the first electrode $V(z_0,t_m)$ for each timepoint. The membrane
voltage at the other locations was then determined by the traveling-wave
assumption: $V(z_n,t_m) = V(z_0,t_m-\frac{z_n-z_0}{v})$, using a linear
interpolation between timepoints. The model assumption of a single line of
axons at a fixed distance is a strong simplification, since the fibers are most
likely distributed all around the electrode. The distance parameter $\rho$ can
be thought of as an average distance in this simplification.

To aid the convergence of the algorithm, an
initial guess for the number of the fibers was set by hand. Initializing the
guess to constant or fully random number of fibers caused a failure to converge, but we
found that several Gaussian-like initial guesses converged to an almost
identical solution, meaning that the specific initial guess did not
 alter the fit result. The results shown in @fig:barnowl were obtained with
an initial guess of a Gaussian with amplitude 12, centered at penetration depth
725 $\mu$m, and standard deviation 400 $\mu$m.

Because of the linearity of equations 1-4 in $I$ and $V$, inferring the
membrane voltage $V$ from the average over trials of the EFP $\Phi$ produces
the average membrane voltage $V$. This in turn is the membrane voltage response
of a single spike convolved with the peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH).
