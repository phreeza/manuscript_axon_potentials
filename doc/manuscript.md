title: Extracellular potentials generated by axonal projections are shaped by patterns of bifurcations and terminations

date: \today

abstract: Extracellular field potentials are an important source of information in neuroscience. Despite sustained experimental and theoretical efforts, the physiological basis of extracellular field potentials in the brain are in many cases still a matter of debate. Axonal sources are frequently discounted in the interpretation of data, and rarely included in models. In this study, we experimentally and theoretically examined the contributions of axons to extracellular field potentials. We first used a detailed biophysical model as well as a simplified analytical model of action potentials propagating in bifurcating and terminating axons to explain the magnitude and spatial reach of the generated extracellular field potential. The contributions were especially prominent when there was a zone in which the axons branch and terminate in close succession. This type of axonal structure is found in many brain regions and referred to as a terminal zone. Our models predicted a dipolar component, including a characteristic polarity reversal at the center of the terminal zone. We tested this prediction using data obtained from the barn owl auditory brainstem. Axons in the nucleus laminaris form stereotypical terminal zones, and we recorded the extracellular potential in response to monaural acoustic clicks, at different locations throughout the nucleus using a multielectrode array. The data showed the spatiotemporal structure of the potentials to be in accordance with our models. Together, these results demonstrate that axons contribute more to extracellular field potentials in the brain than previously thought.

Introduction
==============
Extracellular field potentials (EFPs) are at the heart of many experimental
approaches used to examine the inner workings of the brain.  There are
invasively recorded signals such as the electrocorticogram (ECoG), the local field
potential (LFP), the current source density (CSD), and the multiunit activity (MUA) as
well as the noninvasively recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) and the auditory
brainstem response (ABR) [@Brette2012Handbook; @Nunez2006Electric]. The origins
of these signals, especially in cases in which the activity is not clearly
attributable to a single cell, is a matter of debate [@Buzsaki2012Origin].

EFPs in the brain were long thought to be primarily of synaptic origin
[@Buzsaki2012Origin]. As a consequence, many modeling studies focussed on the
extracellular fields induced by postsynaptic currents on the dendrites and the soma
of a neuron [@Gold2006Origin; @Holt1999Electrical;
@Einevoll2013Modelling; @Linden2011Modeling; @Linden2010Intrinsic;
@FernandezRuiz2013Cytoarchitectonic]. However, a number of recent data analyses
and modeling efforts have revealed that active, non-synaptic membrane currents
can play an important role in generating EFPs [@Reimann2013Biophysically;
@Anastassiou2015Cell; @Schomburg2012Spiking; @Ray2011Different;
@Belluscio2012CrossFrequency], including far reaching potentials detectable at
the scalp [@Telenczuk2011Highfrequency; @Telenczuk2015Correlates].
Currents from the axon are still thought to be so small as to be of minor
importance for the EFP.

One of the reasons for the assumption that axonal currents contribute little to
the EFP is that the far field of an action potential traveling along an
idealized straight axon is quadrupolar, meaning that it decays faster with
distance than synaptic sources, which are typically dipolar
[@Nunez2006Electric]. Surprisingly, some experimental studies indicated that the EFP of
axonal responses can also have a dipolar structure. For example,
@Blot2014Ultrarapid recorded from the vicinity of cerebellar Purkinje cell
axons and reported an EFP with a characteristic dipolar structure;
other studies [@Swadlow2002Activation;@Swadlow2000Influence] showed that the axonal part of the EFP of
thalamocortical afferents showed a polarity reversal as associated with a
dipolar source, and classical current source density studies found dipolar current
distributions in axonal terminal zones in the cortex and lateral geniculate
nucleus, and attributed these to axons by means of conduction velocity
estimation [@Mitzdorf1985Current]. Here we present a
further well developed example of a dipolar, axonal field potential from the auditory
brainstem of the barn owl.

The discrepancy between the quadrupolar structure of EFPs generated by
idealized axons, and the experimentally observed
dipolar structure raises the question of how axons are able to generate
dipolar field potentials. Here, we show how dipolar far fields in the EFP of axons
can be explained by the axons' anatomical structure. In particular, we show
that the branchings and terminations of axons in their terminal zone area can lead
to a dipolar EFP structure. Such axon bundles, often also called 
fascicles, exist throughout the peripheral and central nervous system [@kandel2000principles; @Hentschel1999Models; @Nornes1972Temporal;
@Goodman1984Cell]. The white matter of the mammalian brain can be viewed as an
agglomeration of such bundles [@Schuz2002Human]. We therefore predict
pronounced contributions of nerves or fascicles to EFPs, which are neglected in
current models.

In what follows, properties of the EFP due to axonal projections are first
investigated by a numerical model based on forward simulation
[@Holt1999Electrical; @Gold2006Origin]. This first model includes a large-scale
multi-compartment model of an axon population. We then outline the basic
mechanisms by means of a second, analytically tractable, model of a generic
axon bundle. Finally, we validate model predictions with data from multi-site
in-vivo electrophysiological recordings from the barn owl auditory brain stem.

Results
==============

Effects of axonal bifurcations and terminations on extracellular action potentials
----

To understand how the geometry of an axon affects the extracellular waveform
associated with action potentials, we first numerically simulated single action
potentials propagating along generic axons and calculated their contribution to
the EFP. We began by simulating an
infinitely long axon following a straight line path, neither bifurcating nor
terminating ([@fig:simpletree]A). The extracellular action potential has the
characteristic triphasic shape. As the action potential travels from top to
bottom, the waveform is translated in time with the conduction velocity, but is
otherwise unchanged.

There are two ways of understanding the triphasic shape of the extracellular
waveform. One way is by attribution of the peaks of the response to individual
current types. The first, small positive peak corresponds to the capacitive
current, the large and negative second peak to the sodium current, and the
final positive peak to the potassium current [@Gold2006Origin]. Another, more
mathematical way of understanding the triphasic shape is specific to the nature
of the axon. Due to Kirchhoff's law and cable theory (see Materials and
Methods), the local transmembrane current in an axon is proportional to the
second spatial derivative of the membrane potential along the direction of the
axon. Because the action potential is roughly a traveling wave, the currents
are also proportional to the second *temporal* derivative of the membrane
potential. The three extrema of the EFP are thus related to the points of
maximum curvature in the action potential waveform, namely the onset, the
maximum, and the end of the spike.

Next we simulated the response of an axon that terminates ([@fig:simpletree]B).
Here the approaching action potential (top traces) has the same, triphasic
shape as in the non-branching case. When the action potential reaches the
termination point, it gradually deforms into a biphasic response, with a
positive peak preceding a negative peak. The mechanism for this deformation can
be understood as follows: As the action potential approaches the recording
location next to the termination, the majority of the transmembrane currents flow at points
located before the termination, and they are almost identical to those in the
non-terminating case; the first peak is not affected. As already mentioned, the second and third peaks
of the extracellular action potential in the non-terminating case are generated
by currents close to or after the electrode location. In the terminating
axon, there are no currents at points after the termination,
leading to a partial suppression of the second peak and a complete suppression
of the third peak.

Another generic structure found in axons is a bifurcation. To emphasize the impact of bifurcations, we simulated
a single axon that bifurcates three times on each branch within a distance of
200 µm, leading to a total number of 8 fibers leaving the bifurcation zone
([@fig:simpletree]C). The EFP far away from the bifurcation zone has
a triphasic shape and resembles the one observed in [@fig:simpletree]A, and the
amplitude is proportional to the number of axon fibers. The EFP near the
bifurcation zone has a biphasic
shape. Although there is an initial tiny positive peak, the response is
dominated by the second, negative and the third, positive peak. This waveform
can again be understood by comparison to the first example ([@fig:simpletree]A) containing the
infinitely long axon: The tiny positive initial peak resembles the infinite case, because
most of the action potential-related currents are flowing within the part of
the axon before the bifurcation. As the action potential passes the bifurcation
zone, there are now several action potentials (one in each
fiber). Because of the active nature of the action potential, the active currents are
also multiplied and sum up across the fibers. This leads the second and third
peak to be multiplied in size, yielding a quasi-biphasic response. We chose to
simulate several bifurcations because this leads to a clearer effect in the
EFP. In the case of a single bifurcation, this effect is also present, but the
amplification of the second and third peak relative to the first peak is not as
notable as in this example.

To understand how bifurcations and terminations interact when they are present
in the same axon, we simulated an axon with an identical number of bifurcations
as in the previous case, but then added terminations to all the fibers 200
µm after the bifurcation zone ([@fig:simpletree]D). We found that this
configuration leads to the same biphasic responses as observed in the cases of
the isolated anatomical features. A triphasic response occurred in-between the
bifurcation and termination zones. A notable point here is that the potential
at the bifurcation and termination are both biphasic and on the same timescale,
but opposite in polarity. 

Moving towards more biologically plausible axon geometries, we next considered
a larger population of axons with slightly altered characteristics, where we
randomly perturbed the precise locations of bifurcations and terminations in
the axon tree ([@fig:simpletree]E, left). We furthermore stimulated each axon
with an inhomogeneous Poisson spike train. The driving rate of the
inhomogeneous Poisson process was the same for all axons and consisted of
a constant background rate (100 spikes/s) and a Gaussian pulse of heightened
activity (2000 spikes/s). The standard deviation of the pulse was 1 ms, resulting
in an additional 3.5 spikes being fired on average due to the pulse. The
resulting extracellular waveforms ([@fig:simpletree]E, right) showed a polarity
reversal reminiscent of [@fig:simpletree]D. However, in the bifurcation zone,
the summed contribution from many fibers and action potentials lead to
a monophasic negative peak, and in the termination zone there was a monophasic
positive peak. Interestingly, the summed potential at the center of the
terminal zone largely cancelled out.

The fact that the responses in [@fig:simpletree]E were mostly monophasic was
due to the presence of a non-zero bias in the biphasic responses observed for
the single spike responses. Close to a bifurcation, the area under the negative
part of the curve slightly exceeded that of the positive part, and vice versa
close to a termination. This bias effectively induced a low-frequency component
in the single-spike responses, that is reflected in the population response in
[@fig:simpletree]E.

The reversal behaviour shown in [@fig:simpletree]E is similar to the polarity
reversal associated with a dipole observed in experimental studies
[@Swadlow2000Influence;@Swadlow2002Activation;@Blot2014Ultrarapid]. To summarize, simple
one-dimensional model axon structures can produce complex and diverse
spatiotemporal responses comparable to experimental responses.

Axonal projections generate a dipole-like field potential
-----

Dipole-like EFPs have a much larger spatial reach than quadrupolar-like EFPs,
which are typically associated with axons [@Nunez2006Electric]. To further
understand whether and how axons can generate a dipolar EFP, in [@fig:bigtree] we turned to
three-dimensional axon morphologies, in contrast to the one-dimensional case
studied in [@fig:simpletree]. We thus simulated a parallel fiber bundle that at
first runs at constant diameter without bifurcations and then reaches
a terminal zone. Within this terminal zone, the fibers first bifurcate, which
increases the number of fibers. Finally, as the axons reach the end of the
terminal zone, the number of fibers decreases to zero ([@fig:bigtree]A). To
model more closely the actual axonal structures found in nature, we included
a radial fanning out of the branches as well as a more diverse set of
morphologies with a variable number of bifurcations and terminations (see
Materials and Methods for details).

The spiking activity of a generic axon bundle was simulated by a background
spontaneous firing rate of 100 spikes/s and a short pulse of increased
activity. We chose a Gaussian pulse with an amplitude of 2900 spikes/s and a
standard deviation of 2.8\ ms. These numbers are motivated by the early
auditory system [@koppl97a;@Sullivan1984Segregation;@Konishi1985Owls], where
instantaneous spike rates of 3000 spikes/s occur in repsonse to click stimuli
[@Carr2016Role]. However, our approach is not limited to the auditory system
(which would also require to include phase locking), and this pulse of activity
could relate to various kinds of evoked activity in the nervous system, such as
sensory stimulation, motor activity or a spontaneous transient increase in
population spiking activity.

To characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the evoked EFP, the time course
of the potential was calculated for several locations along the axon trunk. We
divided our analysis into 2 frequency bands by filtering the responses. These
frequency components are sometimes referred to as the LFP (< 1 kHz) and the MUA
(>2.5 kHz). To make the MUA easier to interpret, it was half-wave rectified and
low-pass filtered (see Materials and Methods).

Because we first wanted to study the effect of the Gaussian rate pulse on the
LFP, we low-pass filtered the EFP responses with a cut-off frequency of 1\ kHz
([@fig:bigtree]B). This filtering removed most of the contributions of
individual spikes, while a population-level LFP signal remained. The
distribution of maximum amplitudes of these responses are shown by the  colored
contour lines in [@fig:bigtree]A and the colored voltage traces in
[@fig:bigtree]B. Surrounding the terminal zone of the axon bundle in
[@fig:bigtree]A, LFP amplitudes showed a double-lobed shape that is typical of
a dipole.

In [@fig:bigtree]B, the LFP responses mostly showed monophasic deflections that were
elicited by the population firing rate pulse. Such deflections were visible at
all recording locations. In the radial direction away from the axon tree, i.e. in
horizontal direction in the figure, the LFP amplitude decays. In the axial
direction along the axon tree, i\.e\.\ to the right in the figure, the
voltage deflection reverses polarity in the middle of the terminal zone of the
bundle ([@fig:bigtree]B). The polarity reversal occurs by a decrease of the
amplitude to zero and a subsequent reappearance with reversed polarity (as
opposed to a polarity reversal through a gradual shift in phase). This behaviour
is also typical for a dipolar field potential.

The point of the polarity reversal coincides with the middle of the terminal
zone. Interestingly, this means that the absolute value of the response
amplitude reaches a local minimum just when the number of axonal fibers reaches
a maximum. To better understand how the anatomical features of the axon bundle
and the LFP response amplitude are related, we compared the signed maximum
value (meaning the *signed* value corresponding to the maximum *absolute*
amplitude) of the LFP (black line in [@fig:bigtree]C) with the difference in
the number of branchings and terminations per 200\ µm bin (purple histogram in
[@fig:bigtree]C). Along the nerve trunk the number of fibers is constant. As the axon bundle
reaches its terminal zone, the number of bifurcations increases (purple bars point to the
right in [@fig:bigtree]C). The increase of bifurcations is followed by an
increase of terminations. In the middle of the terminal zone, the number of
bifurcations and terminations are equal. At the same depth, the amplitude of
the LFP component crosses zero.  At the end of the terminal zone, the
terminations outweigh the bifurcations (purple bars point
leftwards in [@fig:bigtree]C). As the axon bundle ends, there are no
longer any bifurcations or terminations, and the number of fibers decays toward
zero. Overall, the signed maximum amplitude LFP (black trace) follows the
distribution of branchings and terminations (purple histogram). 
This progression of amplitudes in the low-frequency components seen in
[@fig:bigtree]C is also visible in [@fig:bigtree]B, most clearly in the first
column. The polarity reversal in the center of [@fig:bigtree]B corresponds to
the crossing of zero amplitude in [@fig:bigtree]C.

<!--To better understand the relationship between axonal anatomy and this spatial
structure of the EFP, we plotted the change in density of the bundle, meaning
the number of terminations subtracted from the number of bifurcations at a
given 

The low-frequency component shows a distinct relationship to the anatomy: it
appears to be governed by the local density of bifurcations and terminations.
Along the nerve trunk the fiber density is constant, and the low frequency
component is unchanged. As the axon bundle reaches its projection zone, the
number of bifurcations increases, and the low frequency component increases in
amplitude. In the middle of the projection zone, the number of bifurcations and
terminations cancels out.  Correspondingly, the low-frequency component
amplitude reaches a local minimum.  As the end of the projection zone
approaches, the terminations outweigh the bifurcations, and the amplitude
increases, but the polarity is reversed (red box in [@fig:bigtree]B). As the
axon bundle ends, there are no longer any bifurcations or terminations, and the
amplitude decays.

The same distribution of maximum amplitudes for the high-frequency component,
shown in [@fig:bigtree]D, did not show the same lobed shape. Instead it decayed
much faster with distance in both axial and radial direction. This was also
reflected in the waveforms (Fig 1E). There is an increase in amplitude due to
the firing rate pulse at locations close to the nerve bundle, but at locations
further away from the trunk it is no longer distinguishable from the background
activity.-->

To understand the EFP contributions related to individual spikes, we next
turned our attention to the high-frequency range. The MUA of the response,
which contains the high-frequency (>2.5\ kHz) components, is thought to reflect
spiking activity. In [@fig:bigtree]D, the maximum amplitudes of the MUA
appeared like an ellipsoid centered at the terminal zone ([@fig:bigtree]D), and
they did not show the double-lobe shape observed for the LFP in
[@fig:bigtree]A.

The shape of the MUA response was weakly dependent on the recording location.
The main change across locations was in the scaling of the amplitude
([@fig:bigtree]E). The amplitude decays with radial distance from the trunk. In
the axial direction, the amplitude reaches its maximum in the middle of the
fiber bundle. This dependence of the MUA amplitude on the axial location is further examined
in [@fig:bigtree]F. The amplitude of the MUA component (black trace) changes in
accordance to the local number of fibers (teal histogram). The local number of
fibers and the MUA amplitude are both constant along the nerve trunk. Both
measures then increases in amplitude as the number of fibers is increased by
bifurcations. As the fibers terminate and the number of fibers decreases, so
does the amplitude of the MUA.

To conclude, we have shown a qualitatively different behaviour in the low- and
high-frequency components of the EFP, i.e. LFP and MUA. The particular branching
and terminating structure of the axon bundle may thus give rise to a dipolar LFP.

Effects of bifurcations and terminations on distance scaling behaviour of EFPs
--------

To further demonstrate that bifurcations and terminations if axons give rise to
a dipolar field, we investigated the effect of an axon terminal structure on
the spatial reach of the EFP ([@fig:distscaling]). Motivated by the
fundamentally different spatial behaviour of the low-frequency LFP and the
high-frequency MUA in [@fig:bigtree], we again differentiated between these
frequency bands and simulated an axon bundle containing a terminal
zone with bifurcations and terminations. Moreover, as a control, we also
simulated an axon bundle without bifurcations in which a fixed number of fibers
simply terminates.

To avoid confounding effects in the spatial reach of the potentials due to the
specific spatial arrangement of axon branches in a single realization of an
axon tree, and to afford better analytic tractability, we transitioned to a simpler
one-dimensional model of the axon bundle (see Materials and Methods). This
model omitted the radial fanning out of the bundle in the terminal zone, as in [@fig:simpletree].
Furthermore, we discarded the detailed conductance-based
simulation of the membrane potential, and instead assumed a fixed membrane
potential waveform traveling along the axon trunk with constant propagation
velocity. In order to measure the EFP responses at all frequencies, we set the
membrane potential with white noise. Using linear cable theory, it was then
possible to calculate the membrane currents necessary for the determination of the
EFP. The simplified model also allowed us to consider a continuous number of
fibers instead of simulating discrete bifurcations and terminations. All
following simulations are based on the simplified model.

We simulated two axon bundle morphologies. The first was a non-bifurcating
bundle, which had a constant number of 50 fibers for $z<0$\ µm, and tapered
out as a Gaussian centered at $z=0$\ µm with a height of 50 fibers and
standard deviation of 500\ µm for $z>0$\ µm. The second case was that
of an axon bundle with a projection zone containing bifurcations. Here we
simulated the same distribution as for the non-bifurcating case, but added a
further Gaussian distribution to account for the bifurcating axons. This
additional Gaussian was also centered at $z=0$\ µm, had the same standard
deviation of 500\ µm but an amplitude of 450 fibers. Unlike the
tapering-out, this component was added for all values of $z$. It resulted in a
maximal fiber number of 500 at $z=0$. Both distributions constructed in this
way were smooth, and had smooth first derivatives in space.

The dipole-like component observed in [@fig:bigtree] had it's dipole axis
aligned with the axon trunk. We therefore expected the amplitude of the field potential to decay
as $r^{-2}$ in this direction, which we call the axial direction. To test
this, we first plotted the amplitude of the low-frequency component (<2.5 \ kHz) in axial
direction in [@fig:distscaling]A. The plot is on a double logarithmic scale,
meaning that the slope of the curve corresponds to the scaling exponent, and
the vertical offset corresponds to the amplitude of the component. We observed the expected
$r^{-2}$ scaling for distances larger than the extent of the
bifurcation zone ($\gtrsim 1$\ mm). Interestingly, the amplitude of the low-frequency
component was an order of magnitude larger in the bifurcating case (solid
line) than in the non-bifurcating case (dashed line).

Next, we examined the high-frequency (>2.5\ kHz)  component
([@fig:distscaling]B). Here the asymptotic scaling was also $r^{-2}$ for axial
distances $> 1$\ mm, but at $> 10$\ mm the amplitudes were similar between
bifurcating and non-bifurcating cases. The difference between the amplitudes of
bifurcating and non-bifurcating bundles is much smaller than in the
low-frequency case, even though the difference in amplitudes was the same at
short distances $< 100$\ µm. At these short distances, the difference is
proportional to the number of fibers, as in [@fig:distscaling]A. To conclude,
the terminal zone contributed mainly to the low-frequency dipole moment of the
EFP. Because of this, in the far field (>1\ mm) the magnitude of the
low-frequency component exceeded the magnitude of the high-frequency component
by an order of magnitude.

In contrast to the axial direction, the dipole hypothesis predicts a different
scaling behaviour of the EFP for the radial direction. The dipole component
becomes zero in the direction perpendicular to the dipole axis, and we thus
expected quadrupolar or higher-order scaling behaviour in this case. In
[@fig:distscaling]C we can see that this is indeed the case for the
low-frequency component. The potentials scale as $r^{-3}$, and the difference in
logarithmic amplitude between bifurcating and non-bifurcating case is roughly
the same at all distances. The high-frequency component also decayed as
$r^{-3}$ in the radial direction ([@fig:distscaling]D), but the difference in
logarithmic amplitudes was slightly diminished at larger distances.

These findings show that there is a dependence of the dipole moment on both the
anatomy (i.e. the presence of a projection zone), and temporal frequency. This
relationship can be qualitatively understood by considering the extent of the
currents due to activity at a given temporal frequency. The temporal frequency
will correspond to a spatial frequency, and the dipole moment will be maximal
if the spatial frequency of the membrane potential and the width of the
projection zone agree, meaning that positive currents flow on one half of the
projection zone whenever negative currents flow on the other side. This notion is
formalized in the last section of the Results. A similar argument can be made
for the quadrupole moment, except that here the frequency must be higher, such
that the projection zone contains two minima and one maximum in the current
distribution, or vice versa.

To quantitatively understand the frequency-specific contributions to the dipole
moments, we examined the scaling behaviour as a function of frequency. The
amplitude of the dipole moment was determined by fitting a straight line with
slope $-2$ to the double logarithmic scaling of the power spectral density. The
power spectral density was averaged over a frequency band 500\ Hz wide, and the
fit was performed for distances $> 1$\ mm. The extrapolation of this straight line to
axial distance 1\ µm was then proportional to the dipole moments.

These frequency-specific dipole moments are shown in [@fig:distscaling]E. The
dipole moment of the bifurcating case (solid line) has a maximum at around 1
kHz, as expected due to the agreement of spatial frequency and projection zone
width. In the non-bifurcating case (dashed line) there is no projection zone
width, and the dipole moment decays monotonically. Here lower frequencies
correspond to a higher spatial separation of positive and negative currents,
and thus a higher dipole moment. We can see that the dipole moment in the
bifurcating case exceeds the non-bifurcating case for low frequencies. For
higher frequencies, there is a mismatch in spatial frequency and projection
zone width, meaning that the projection zone contributes only little to the
dipole moment. This is reflected in the fact that the difference between the
dipole moments diminishes, meaning that they are formed by the incoming fibers,
and not the bifurcation zone.

As in any multipole expansion, the dipolar component will dominate the EFP at
long distances in all directions except for those perpendicular to the dipole
axis. At shorter distances, as well as in the plane perpendicular to the dipole
axis, the quadrupolar component becomes important. For this reason we also
examined the frequency specific quadrupole moments. This meant fitting a line
in radial direction with slope -3 to the power spectral density.

The resulting quadrupole moments are shown in [@fig:distscaling]F. From the
qualitative argument made above, we expect the existence of an optimal
frequency for the contribution of the projection zone. Indeed we find that the
quadrupole moment of the bifurcating case (solid line) has a maximum at around
2\ kHz, and the quadrupole moment of the non-bifurcating case (dashed line) is
monotonically decreasing (as was the case for the dipole moment). As expected,
the maximum lies at a higher frequency than that for the dipole moment.

In the bifurcating case, the number of fibers was increased by a factor of 10.
This means that an increase in the moments due to the bifurcations greater than
10 can be called supralinear. In [@fig:distscaling]G we compare this relative
impact of the terminal zone on dipole moments (red line) and quadrupole moments (black
line), by plotting their ratios across frequencies. Here we can see that for
low frequencies the ratio for the quadrupole moment approaches values lower
than 10, meaning that there is only little additional contribution from the
terminal zone. The dipole moment approaches a factor of 10 for low frequencies,
meaning that the terminal zone contributes in proportion to the number of added
fibers. In both components, the contribution is maximal for intermediate
frequencies, with the maximal dipolar contribution lying at lower frequencies
than the quadrupolar component, as predicted. For very high frequencies, both contributions
return to values below 10. The terminal zone has a supralinear contribution
(factor greater than 10) for the dipole at frequencies below $\approx$ 3.5\ kHz and for
the quadrupolar component at frequencies between $\approx$ 1 and 4.5\ kHz.

Together, these observations show us that the terminal zone makes a strong
contribution to the far-reaching dipole field potential of the axon bundle. At
somewhat higher frequencies, the more local quadrupolar potential is also
increased. This gives us a deeper understanding of the findings of
[@fig:bigtree]: At low frequencies, we observed a dipolar behaviour due to the
strong contribution of the bundle at these frequencies, with the projection
zone forming the dipole axis. At high frequencies, the quadrupolar moments
dominate the responses, meaning that we do not observe a dipolar structure.

The barn owl neurophonic potential in nucleus laminaris as an example for a dipolar field in an axonal terminal zone.
----

In order to test the dipole prediction of our model of the extracellular field
of axon bundles, we recorded EFP responses from the barn owl auditory brain
stem. The barn owl has a highly developed auditory system with a strong
frequency following response (up to 9\ kHz, @Koppl1997b) in the EFP, called the
neurophonic, which can be recorded in the nucleus laminaris (NL). In NL, the
input from the two ears is first integrated to calculate the azimuthal location
of a sound source, and this information is encoded in the EFP [@carr90]. The
EFP in this region is mainly due to the efferent activity, and the contribution
of spikes of NL neurons is small [@Kuokkanen2010Origin;@Kuokkanen2013Linear].
Furthermore, the anatomy of the efferent axons is well known and follows a
stereotypical pattern [@carr88;@carr90]: Two fiber bundles enter the nucleus,
with fibers from the contralateral ear entering ventrally, and from the
ipsilateral ear entering dorsally. The axon bundles reach the nucleus from the
previous nucleus without bifurcating, then bifurcate multiple times at the
border of the NL, and then terminate within NL. Axon bundles have a strong
directional preference and run roughly in parallel. This well studied
physiology and anatomy makes the system an ideal candidate to investigate the
EFPs of axon bundles.

To explore the spatiotemporal structure of the EFP in NL, we performed
simultaneous multi-electrode recordings of the response in NL
([@fig:expmethod]A) to contralateral monaural click stimuli. The click responses
showed distinct high- and low-frequency components, as previously reported
[@wagner09]. The frequency of the high-frequency ([@fig:expmethod]C) ringing
corresponds to the recording location on the frequency map within NL and
ringing reflects the frequency tuning and phase locking of the incoming axons.
In addition, there is a low-frequency component in the response
([@fig:expmethod]B). We filtered the data to roughly separate these components.
The cutoff to split the components was set to 2\ kHz because this frequency was
always well below the high-frequency ringing component.

The same simplified model used in [@fig:distscaling] was fit to the data by
performing a nonlinear least squares optimization. Free parameters were (1) the
number of fibers at the depth of each recording location, (2) the average
spatial derivative of the membrane potential over time in a single fiber at the
location next to the most dorsal electrode, (3) the axonal conduction velocity,
and (4) the distance between bundle and electrode array.

The resulting EFP responses and the model fit are depicted in [@fig:barnowl].
[@fig:barnowl]C shows the high-frequency ($\geq 2$\ kHz) response. The orange
lines indicate the actual responses in the data. The responses have a
Gabor-like shape, as expected [@wagner09], with maximum amplitude in the center
of the recording array, at around 850\ µm penetration depth. The axonal
conduction velocity was calculated to be 4.0 m/s. A previously published
estimate of the axonal conduction velocity in this nucleus
[@McColgan2014Functional] gave a confidence bound of 0.4-6 m/s . Toward the
edges (< 100 and > 1400\ µm), the amplitude decays. In the central region
(400-1200\ µm recording depth, a systematic shift in delay can be observed,
while the response seems to be stationary in the more dorsal and ventral
electrodes. The delay increases from ventral to dorsal, which is consistent
with the anatomy for contralateral stimulation. All these aspects of the data
are qualitatively reproduced by the model (purple traces). The main deviation
between model and data lies in a diminished amplitude of the oscillation at the
most central electrode sites. Because the phase shift in the central region is
mainly determined by the conduction velocity, this mismatch might be due to a
slightly changing conduction velocity in the nucleus. A diminished amplitude in
the fit could reflect an inability of the model to exactly match the phase
progression. Another possible explanation is that the additional amplitude
could be due to non-axonal sources such as synaptic currents or postsynaptic
spikes, which do not follow the assumptions underlying the model being fit.

The low-frequency ($30$\ Hz - $2$\ kHz, [@fig:barnowl]D) responses reveal the
typical polarity reversal that we predicted for an axonal terminal zone
(Figures 1 and 2). The responses at the dorsal and ventral edges show the same
shape, but with opposite polarity, as expected for a dipolar field. Note that
for a pure dipole field, the amplitude of the central responses have zero
amplitude. In the data shown here, central responses show a diminished maximum
amplitude, which reveals the contribution of the quadrupole component. The
model is able to capture the behaviour of this quadrupolar component as well, with a slight
underestimation of the amplitude of the peak at ventral locations. The model
even captures a small oscillation in the data with period\ of\ 
$\approx 1$\ ms in the center of the recording. Here, too, the small deviations are likely
due to a slightly inhomogeneous conduction velocity or non-axonal sources.

[@fig:barnowl]A shows the inferred average over trials of the deviation of the
membrane voltage from the resting potential in response to the stimulus, at a
location in the axon next to the first electrode, obtained from the fit. The
voltage is composed of high- and low-frequency components similar to those
observed in the EFP. When comparing this inferred membrane potential response
to the measured EFP response, the most salient difference is the different
sizes of the frequency components. In the EFP, the low-frequency component has
a comparable amplitude to the high-frequency component, but in the membrane
voltage the low-frequency component is much larger. This is due to the fact
that the second derivative term in the current equation essentially imposes a
high-pass filter on the membrane voltage.

The inferred number of fibers is shown in [@fig:barnowl]B. The density (number
of fibers per unit length) is shown as a function of dorsoventral depth,
meaning that the vertical axis of [@fig:barnowl]C and [@fig:barnowl]D corresponds to
the horizontal axis in [@fig:barnowl]B. The density has its maximum at the center of the
electrode array, and decays steadily to both sides. This profile of the number of fibers
is consistent with the known anatomy of axons in NL. The density does not decay
to zero on either side, which may be due to the limited range of recording
locations. The number of fibers beyond the border of the nucleus in dorsal
direction should be zero, because it is known from anatomy that all fibers
terminate within the nucleus.

We performed the fitting procedure for 26 recordings from 3 different owls,
with stimulation from both ears (implying the activation of distinct axonal
populations). The average correlation coefficient for all recordings was
$R^2=0.56\pm 0.15$.

Dipole moments of idealized axon bundles
----

Based on our model we were also able to analytically derive the dipole maximal moment
$p_\text{max}$ of a simplified axon bundle with a projection zone. We assumed a Gaussian
waveform for the membrane potential of a single spike, with an amplitude of
$\bar{V}_{\text{spike}}$ and a width of $\sigma_{\text{spike}}$.
The resting membrane potential was irrelevant because only the first and second
derivatives of the membrane potential contribute. The axon bundle population was
assumed to be driven with a Gaussian firing-rate pulse with maximum firing rate
$\bar{\lambda }_{\text{pulse}}$ and width $\sigma_{\text{pulse}}$.
The distribution of the number of fibers at a given depth location was also
described with a Gaussian, with width $\sigma_n$ and maximum number $\bar{n}$.
This is an adequate approximation, if the spikes in the incoming fibers
contribute little to the dipole moment before reaching the
projection zone. In
this scenario, we calculated the maximum dipole moment of the bundle (see
Materials and Methods for derivation) to be:

$$p_\text{max} = \frac{2 a^2 \pi^2}{r_L\sqrt{e}} \cdot
\frac{v \sigma_n \sigma_{\text{pulse}} \sigma_{\text{spike}} \bar{n} \bar{\lambda}_{\text{pulse}} \bar{V}_{\text{spike}}}
{\left(\sigma_n^2+v^2 \left(\sigma_{\text{pulse}}^2+\sigma_{\text{spike}}^2\right)\right)}$$.

This formula tells us that the dipole moment is maximal whenever the three
(spatial) widths $\sigma_n$, $v\sigma_{\text{pulse}}$ and
$v\sigma_{\text{spike}}$ are of the form $w_1^1=w_2^2+w_3^3$, where $w_1$ is
the largest of the three terms, while $w_2$ and $w_3$ are the other two terms,
regardless of order. The dipole moment is thus maximal when the widths of the
pulses agree. In particular, if $\sigma_n$ is the widest, then the dipole
moment is maximal if $\sigma_n$ is equal to the width of $\lambda(t)\ast
V_\text{spike}(t,x)$, which is
$v\sqrt{\sigma_{\text{spike}}+\sigma_{\text{pulse}}}$.

Using this formula, it is then possible to calculate the expected contributions
to the EFP for different scenarios. To test the approximation in the case of
the barn owl, we chose the following values: axon diameter $a$\ =\ 2\ µm,
conduction velocity $v$\ =\ 1\ $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$, axial resistivity
$r_L$\ =\ 1 $\Omega\text{m}$, $\sigma_n$\ =\ 250 µm, $\sigma_\text{spike}$\ =\
250 µs, $\sigma_\text{pulse}$\ =\ 2 ms, $\sigma_e$\ =\ 0.33\ $\frac{\text{S}}{\text{m}}$,
$\bar{n}$\ =\ 4000, $\bar{V}_{\text{spike}}$\ =\ 70 mV,
$\bar{\lambda}_\text{pulse}$\ =\ 2000\ spikes/s. This lead to a value
for the dipole moment of $p_\text{max} \approx$ 0.8 $\text{µA}\cdot\text{mm}$.
At a distance of 750 µm, roughly the furthest distance recorded with the
multielectrode array in [@fig:expmethod] and [@fig:barnowl], this corresponded
to a field potential of 0.35 mV, consistent with our experimental findings. We
also calculated the contribution expected at 2 cm from NL, aiming to estimate
the contribution to the ABR. Multiplying by a factor of 2 to account for the
fact that there is an NL on each hemisphere, the predicted contribution was
0.98 µV.

For thalamocortical projections, @Swadlow2000Influence reported amplitudes of
extracellular spike-related potentials called axon terminal potentials (AxTP),
at various locations. At 400 µm from the center of the dipole, the
amplitude of the response was $\approx$\ 1\ µV. Individual thalamocortical
axons are thin and have large and highly branched projection zones
[@Feldmeyer2012Excitatory], so we estimated $\sigma_n$\ =\ 250 µm and
$\bar{n}$\ =\ 30 and $a$\ =\ 1\ µm. We assumed a jitter in the arrival time
instead of a true activity pulse, $\sigma_\text{pulse}$\ =\ 125\ µs, and
normalized the pulse to have area 1, because we were considering a spike
triggered average. The conduction velocity has been reported
as $v$\ =\ 8.5\ m/s [@Simons2007Thalamocortical]. Leaving all other
values as in the previous approximation, we arrived at a dipole moment of
$p_\text{max} \approx$ 1.5 $\text{µA}\cdot\text{µm}$, yielding an
extracellular spike amplitude of $\approx$ 2.3\ µV at the distance of 400\ 
µm, which is on the same order of magnitude as the value ($\approx$ 1\ µV) reported by
@Swadlow2000Influence.

Discussion
==============
Based on numerical simulations, analytical calculations, and experimental data,
we show how axonal fiber bundles contribute to the EFP, and we
explain how the contributions are shaped by axonal morphology. There are
three principal effects of axon bundle structure on the EFP. Firstly, the
low-frequency components of the EFP are governed by the densities of
bifurcations and terminations and can have a dipolar structure
([@fig:simpletree] and [@fig:bigtree]). Secondly, the high-frequency components
are governed by the local number of fibers ([@fig:bigtree]). Furthermore, we
show that the low-frequency components exceed the high-frequency components in
spatial reach. In particular, the dipolar low-frequency components are not
negligible and exceed the reach of the presumed quadrupolar nature of axonal
EFPs ([@fig:distscaling]).

Relevance to interpretation of electrophysiological recordings
----

The low- and high-frequency components show qualitatively different behaviours
as a function of recording location relative location with respect to the
terminal zone. The low-frequency component is a largely stationary
phenomenon, while the high-frequency component shifts gradually in space as a function of
the axonal conduction velocity ([@fig:barnowl]). Due to the difference in
reach, the high-frequency component is most suitable for the study of local
phenomena, while the low-frequency component bears information about locations
more distant from the recording site ([@fig:distscaling]).

These findings relate to the interpretation of a wide range of
electrophysiological data. Heuristics that are valid for the analysis of EFPs
of synaptic, dendritic, or somatic currents may not be valid for axon bundles.
When performing a typical current source density analysis, the local number of
fibers cannot be disentangled from membrane current density
[@Nicholson1973Theoretical]. The membrane current densities can vary with time
and location independently. In the case of an axonal fiber bundle as discussed
here, the situation is different: the number of fibers is variable in space, in
particular in the terminal zone, but the membrane voltages are highly
determined over space and time due to the signal propagation in the axon. The
sink and source distribution found in classical CSD analysis of axon bundles
[@Mitzdorf1978Prominent;@Mitzdorf1985Current;@Mitzdorf1977Laminar], show a
dipolar structure in terminal zones. Our modelling approach provides a novel
way of interpreting these findings.

Dipolar fields also play an important role in the generation of electrical
field potentials at greater distances from the brain. The most prominent of
these is the EEG, which is commonly attributed to the dipolar contributions of
pyramidal cells [@Nunez2006Electric]. We propose that axonal contributions
might also be relevant in the analysis of these fields. This is particularly
true for the auditory brainstem response, which is closely related to the EEG
and involves brain structures that display high degrees of synchrony as well as
axonal organization, and are thus ideal candidates for the generation of axonal
field potentials visible at long ranges. This would in turn have implications
for the interpretation of the ABR in clinical contexts.

The ABR of the barn owl has been reported to be on the order of 10 µV
[@PalancaCastan2016Binaural], while we estimated a contribution on the order of
1 µV from the incoming axons in NL alone. This initial estimate suggests
that there may indeed be measurable components due to axons in the EEG.
However, this estimate is crude because it did not take into account the
anatomy of the skull except for its size. Future studies based on a more
detailed skull model and paired recordings of ABR and EFP will hopefully
improve our understanding of the true contributions axons make to the ABR.

Dipolar EFPs in other animals and brain regions
----

It is interesting to note that a similar dipole-like reversal of polarity as
shown here for the barn owl NL has been reported in the chicken NL
[@Schwarz1992Can], as well as in the mammalian analog to NL, the medial
superior olive [@McLaughlin2010Oscillatory]. The phase reversal in this case has
been modeled based on the assumption that the postsynaptic NL and
MSO dendrites with their bipolar morphology generate the dipolar EFP response
[@McLaughlin2010Oscillatory; @Goldwyn2014Model]. However, in the owl this dipolar
morphology is largely absent [@carr90], making dendritic sources unlikely. This
suggests that similar dipolar field potentials in owls and mammals emerge from
different physiological substrates. Such a convergence might point towards an
evolutionary pressure favouring such an EFP structure in coincidence detection
systems, and indeed @Goldwyn2016Neuronal have proposed a model in which this extracellular
potential enhances the function of coincidence detectors through a form of
ephaptic interaction. Their approach centers on dendrites and is not directly
transferable, but it seems possible that a similar mechanism might arise in the
barn owl NL based on axonal EFPs.

One assumption underlying our modelling of axonal geometries is that there
exists a preferential direction of growth of the axon arbor. In many structures
this is the case, for example in the parts of the auditory brainstem we studied
here. In other brain regions, this tendency is not as prominent, with a
spectrum existing between completely directed and undirected growth. More
undirected growth would lead to a more diffuse response in the EFP, and
eventually to a cancellation of the dipolar field potentials. @Cuntz2010One and
@Budd2010Neocortical studied the principles underlying the growth patterns of
axons and found that the degree of direction in the growth of an axon depends
on the balance struck between conduction delay and wiring cost. Optimizing for
minimal conduction time leads to highly directed structures, while optimizing
wiring cost leads to more tortuous, undirected growth. This leads to the
conclusion that directed structures and thus also strong, dipolar EFPs due to
axons may be more prevalent in systems which require high temporal precision.

Conclusion
----

In conclusion, axonal projections can contribute substantially to EFPs. The
analysis of the responses provides insight into both the underlying anatomy as
well as the activity of axons. Future studies of axonal EFPs will shed light on
the temporal and spatial structure of efferent activity in many brain regions.

Experimental recordings
-----------------------

The experiments were conducted at the Department of Biology of the University
Maryland. Data was collected from three barn owls (*Tyto furcata pratincola*).
Procedures conformed to NIH Guidelines for Animal Research and were approved by
the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland. Anaesthesia
was induced prior to each experiment by intramuscular injection of a total of
$8-10$ ml/kg of $20\%$ urethane divided into three to four injections over the
course of $3$ hours. Body temperature was maintained at $39^\circ$C by a
feedback-controlled heating blanket.

Recordings were made in a sound-attenuating chamber (Acoustic Systems Inc.,
Austin, TX, USA). Tungsten electrodes with impedances between $2$ and $20$
M$\Omega$ were used to find suitable recording locations in NL. Once NL had
been located, the tungsten electrode was retracted and replaced with a 32 channel
multi-electrode array (A1x32-15mm-50-413-A32, Neuronexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
The multi-electrode array was lowered using a microdrive (MP225, Sutter
Instruments Co., Novato, CA, USA) during continuous presentation of a
white-noise burst stimulus until visual inspection of the waveform showed that
NL was at the center of the array. A grounded silver chloride pellet, placed
under the animal's skin around the incision, served as the animal ground electrode.
Electrode signals were amplified by a headstage (HS36, Neuralynx Inc., Tucson,
AZ, USA). An adapter (ADPT-HS36-N2T-32A, Neuralynx Inc.) was used between the
electrode and the headstage. A further adapter (ADPT-HS-36-ERP-27, Neuralynx
Inc.) was used between the headstage and the control panel in order to map all 32
channels to the amplifiers. Pre-amplified electrode signals were passed to the
control panel (ERP27, Neuralynx Inc.), then to four 8-channel amplifiers
(Lynx-8, Neuralynx Inc.), and then to an analogue-to-digital converter (Cheetah
Digital Interface, Neuralynx Inc.) connected to a personal computer running
Cheetah5 software (Neuralynx Inc.) where the responses were stored for off-line
analysis.

Acoustic stimuli were digitally generated by a custom-made \textsc{Matlab}
(MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) script driving a signal-processing board (RX6,
Tucker-Davis Techonologies, Alachua, FL, USA) at a sampling rate of 195.3125\ kHz. The sound stimuli
were attenuated using a programmable attenuator (PA5, Tucker-Davis
Techonologies). Click stimuli were generated as a single
half-wave of a 5\ kHz sine tone. Miniature earphones were inserted into the
owl's ear canals and fixed to a headplate. Acoustic stimuli were fed to these
earphones. Stimulus delivery was triggered by National Instruments equipment
(NI USB-6259 and BNC-2090A, National Instruments Inc, Austin, TX, USA), and
stimulus presentation times were recorded along with the responses. Trigger
pulses were configured in \textsc{MatLab} through Ephus software (Vidrio
Technologies LLC, Ashburn, VA, USA).

Numerical model
---------------------

We modeled axons using NEURON [@Hines1997NEURON; @Hines2009NEURON] and extended
previous work by @Kuba2009Roles, which included the high- and low-threshold
potassium channels used by @Rathouz1998Characterization. The axon was modeled
as a sequence of active nodes and passive myelinated segments. The nodes
and myelinated segments had lengths of 2\ µm and 75\ µm, respectively. Unlike previous
models, we included branching axons in our simulations. Branches were generated by
connecting two passive segments to a node, and continuing the alternation of
active and passive segments in each resulting branch. In cases where
the positions of bifurcations or terminations were fixed, the last segment
was shortened in order to obtain the total length before the next bifurcation
or termination.

To evoke an action potential at a designated spike time, a special conductance was temporarily activated
in the first node of Ranvier. The conductance had a reversal
potential of 0 mV, a maximal amplitude of 0.05\ µS, and a time course
described by an alpha-function with time constant 0.01\ ms. Soma and axon
initial segment were not modeled explicitly. 

For the simplified axon geometries used in [@fig:simpletree], the branching
pattern was fixed as described in the caption, with the exception of
the axial position of the branching points in [@fig:simpletree]E, where a random
offset between branching points was drawn from a gamma distribution with mean
400 µm and standard deviation 300 µm. The initial branching point was
offset from the original location by a distance drawn from a
Gaussian distribution with mean zero and a width of 300 µm.
This was done to smooth out the effects of individual branchings or
terminations and show the population response.

For the axon populations seen in [@fig:bigtree], branching patterns were generated
procedurally, starting with a root segment. In order to avoid artifacts from
the stimulus and to simulate a fiber tract prior to the terminal zone, a
sequence of 10 active and passive segments without bifurcations was assumed
before the terminal zone. To this root, segments were appended iteratively.
Before adding a segment, a decision whether to branch or terminate an axon was
drawn from a probability distribution that was dependent on the axial position of the
end of the previous segment. These probability distributions were modeled as
logistic functions with the parameters adjusted to roughly match the numbers of
branchings and terminations shown by 
@carr90. Thus, an initial phase dominated by bifurcations was followed by a
phase dominated by terminations, with the probability of termination reaching 100\% at
the end of the terminal zone. The distribution of bifurcations had its
maximum at axial location $z=0$ with a standard deviation of 200 µm. The distribution of
terminations had its maximum at at $z=500$ µm, with a standard deviation of 100 µm. The
branching angle had an average of $20^\circ$, with a standard deviation of
$5^\circ$. At branching points, the plane containing the branches had a uniform random
orientation, resulting in a 3-dimensional structure of the axon bundle.

Numerical simulations of action potentials propagating along these axons
yielded the membrane currents from which we calculated the extracellular
fields. This procedure is described in detail by @Gold2006Origin.
Briefly, the extracellular medium is assumed to be a homogeneous volume
conductor with conductivity $\sigma_e$, and a quasi-static approximation of the
electrical field potential $\phi$ is made. The extracellular potential
$\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$ at location $\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$ due to a current
distribution $I(\mathbf{r},t)$ is then governed by the equation $\Delta
\phi(\mathbf{r},t) = \frac{1}{\sigma_e} I(\mathbf{r},t)$, with $\Delta$
denoting the Laplace operator [@Nunez2006Electric]. If the currents $I$ are constrained to a volume
$W$, this equation has the solution \begin{equation}
\phi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{W}\frac{I(\mathbf{r}',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}\textrm{d}\mathbf{r}'
\label{eqn:basic} \end{equation} Since the majority of the current flows
through the small nodes of Ranvier, we used the point-source approximation; we
did not use the line-source approximation [@Holt1999Electrical].

Analysis of the resulting extracellular potential included filtering. All
filtering was performed with third-order Butterworth filters. The multiunit
activity (MUA) was calculated by high-pass filtering the signal with a cutoff
of 2500\ Hz, setting all samples with negative values to zero, and then
low-pass filtering the resulting response with a cutoff of 500\ Hz. The LFP was
calculated by low-pass filtering the signal with a cutoff of 1000\ Hz.

Simplified axon-bundle model
----------------------------

\label{sec:efpresp}

To better understand the processes leading to the complex spatio-temporal
patterns of extracellular fields, we devised an analytically tractable model of
the responses. We defined the spatial dimension in cylindrical coordinates
$\mathbf{r}=(\rho,\varphi,z)$, and we considered a simple model axon bundle
that extended infinitely in the axial $z$-direction at $\rho=0$. The bundle had
a variable number of fibers along the $z$ axis, denoted by $n(z)$, each of
which cylindrical with an identical radius $a$. This meant that the total cross-sectional area $A$ at a given depth $z$ was given by $A(z)=\pi a^2 n(z)$. We assumed the axons to be perfect
transmission lines, meaning that the action potential is a traveling wave with
velocity $v$ along the axon. In particular, we neglected any delays and
distortions that can be induced when an axon branches or terminates. In this
case, the membrane voltage was the same in each fiber for a given $z$
coordinate. From linear cable theory [e.g. @Jack75Electric], we then obtained
the following expression for the total transmembrane current per unit length $I(z,t)$ from a
given membrane potential $V(z,t)$:

\begin{align}
I(z,t)& = \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left(\frac{A(z)}{r_L}\frac{\partial }{\partial z}V(z,t)\right)\\
&= \frac{\pi a^2}{r_L}\frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left(n(z)\frac{\partial }{\partial z}V(z,t)\right)\\
&= \frac{\pi a^2}{r_L}\left(\frac{\partial n}{\partial z}(z)\cdot\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}(z,t)+n(z)\cdot\frac{\partial ^2V}{\partial z^2}(z,t)\right)
\label{eqn:current}
\end{align}
<!--
\\
&= \frac{\partial n}{\partial z}(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v}\frac{\partial V}{\partial
t}(z,t)+n(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial ^2V}{\partial t^2}(z,t)

from which, together with the fact that the axial conductivity is proportional
to the number of fibers $g_{tot}=ng$ we can then derive the membrane currents
flowing at a given location:

\begin{align}
I(z,t)& = \frac{d}{dz}\left(n(z)\frac{d}{dz}V(z,t)\right)\\
&= \frac{dn}{dz}(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v}\frac{dV}{dt}(z,t)-n(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{d^2V}{dt^2}(z,t)
\end{align}

Applying this membrane current to equation (\ref{eqn:basic}), we calculated the
corresponding extracellular field potential $\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$ of a given
membrane potential waveform $V(z,t)$ propagating through such an axon bundle.
Due to the rotational symmetry of the system and the fact that current flows
only at $\rho = 0$, we obtained

\begin{align}
    \phi(\mathbf{r},t) =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{I(z',t)}{\sqrt{(z-z')^2 + \rho^2}}\textrm{d}z'
\end{align}

which is independent of the angle $\varphi$.

To derive the dipole moment of a simplified projection zone, we consider an
axon bundle in which identical spikes with the waveform $V_\text{spike}(t,z)$
propagate as traveling waves with a velocity $v$: $V_\text{spike}(t,z) =
V_\text{spike}(z/v-t)$. If each of the fibers is stimulated with an
inhomogeneous Poisson process, with the driving rate $\lambda(t)$ shared among
all axons, the average membrane potential across fibers will be
$V_\text{membrane}(z,t) = V_\text{spike}(z/v-t)\ast \lambda(t)$, where $\ast$
denotes the convolution in time. Plugging this into \ref{eqn:current}, we obtain
\begin{align} I(z,t)& = \frac{\pi a^2}{r_L}\left(\frac{\partial n}{\partial
z}(z)\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(V_\text{spike}(z/v-t)\ast
\lambda(t))+n(z)\cdot\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial z^2}(V_\text{spike}(z/v-t)\ast
\lambda(t)) \right) \\ & = \frac{\pi
a^2}{r_L}\lambda(t)\ast\left(\frac{\partial n}{\partial
z}(z)\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial
z}(V_\text{spike}(z/v-t))+n(z)\cdot\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial
z^2}(V_\text{spike}(z/v-t)) \right) \end{align}

Assuming Gaussian shapes for the firing rate pulse $\lambda(t) = \bar\lambda
e^{-\frac{t^2}{2\sigma_\text{pulse}}}$, the spike $V_\text{spike}(z/v-t) =
\bar{V}_\text{spike} e^{-\frac{(z/v-t)^2}{2\sigma_\text{spike}}}$ and the fiber
bundle projection zone $n(z) = \bar{n} e^{-\frac{z^2}{2\sigma_\text{n}}}$, we
are able to take advantage of the fact that the product and the convolution of
two Gaussians are again Gaussian, and obtain 

\begin{align}\label{eqn:simple_dipole_cur} I(z,t)&=\bar{n} \bar{\lambda
}_{\text{pulse}} \bar{V}_{\text{spike}}  \sqrt{2} \pi ^{3/2} a^2  \cdot \exp
\left(-\frac{z^2}{2 \sigma _n^2}-\frac{(z-t v)^2}{2 v^2 \left(\sigma
_{\text{pulse}}^2+\sigma _{\text{spike}}^2\right)}\right) \\ \nonumber
&\cdot\frac{ \sigma _n^2 \left(-v^2 \sigma _{\text{pulse}}^2-v^2 \sigma
_{\text{spike}}^2+(z-t v)^2\right)-v^2 z \left(\sigma _{\text{pulse}}^2+\sigma
_{\text{spike}}^2\right) (t v-z)}{v^4 r_L \sigma _n^2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sigma
_{\text{pulse}}^2}+\frac{1}{\sigma _{\text{spike}}^2}} \left(\sigma
_{\text{pulse}}^2+\sigma _{\text{spike}}^2\right){}^2} \end{align}


The dipole moment $p(t)$ is defined as $$p(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}z\cdot
I(z,t)\text{d}z$$ into which we can enter Eq. \ref{eqn:simple_dipole_cur} to
obtain $$p(t) =- \bar{n} \bar{\lambda }_{\text{pulse}}
\bar{V}_{\text{spike}}\frac{2 \pi ^2 a^2}{r_L }\frac{v^2 \sigma_n
\sigma_{\text{pulse}} \sigma_{\text{spike}}}{\left(\sigma _n^2+v^2 \left(\sigma
_{\text{pulse}}^2+\sigma _{\text{spike}}^2\right)\right)^{3/2}}\cdot t
e^{\frac{t^2 v^2}{2 \left(\sigma _n^2+v^2 \left(\sigma _{\text{pulse}}^2+\sigma
_{\text{spike}}^2\right)\right)}}$$

This has its maximum amplitude at $t_\text{max}=\frac{\sqrt{\sigma _n^2+v^2
\left(\sigma _{\text{pulse}}^2+ \sigma _{\text{spike}}^2\right)}}{v}$, when the
dipole moment takes the value $$ p_\text{max} = p(t_\text{max}) = \frac{2 a^2
\pi^2}{r_L\sqrt{e}} \cdot \frac{v \sigma_n \sigma_{\text{pulse}}
\sigma_{\text{spike}} \bar{n} \bar{\lambda}_{\text{pulse}}
\bar{V}_{\text{spike}}} {\left(\sigma_n^2+v^2
\left(\sigma_{\text{pulse}}^2+\sigma_{\text{spike}}^2\right)\right)} $$

Equation \ref{eqn:infkern} has the form of a convolution with a weighting
function $w$: \begin{equation} w(\rho,z) =
\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_e}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+\rho^2}} \label{eqn:weighting}
\end{equation}

The convolution can then be written as:

\begin{equation} \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) =
\left[I(z,t)\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z \end{equation}

with the operator $\left[\cdot\ast\cdot\right]_z$ denoting the convolution with
respect to the variable $z$.

Model fitting to experimental data
----------------------------

In order to relate the model to experimentally obtained data, we performed a
nonlinear least squares fit, minimizing the mean squared error $\epsilon$
between the measured potential $\phi_\text{measured}$ and the model prediction
$\phi_\text{model}$ for ${N=32}$ measurement locations $z_n$\ ($n=1,\dots,N$)
and ${M=600}$ time points $t_m$ ($m = 1,\dots,M$): $\epsilon
= \frac{1}{NM}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{m=1}^{M}\left[\phi_\text{measured}(z_n,t_m)-\phi_\text{model}(z_n,t_m)\right]^2$.
The separation between electrodes was given by the electrode layout as 50\ µm.
The time between sampling points was 5.12\ µs. We achieved the
minimization of the error $\epsilon$ using the "optimize.minimize" routine
provided by the \textsc{SciPy} package [@scipy]. The free parameters to be
determined by the optimization routine were the distance $\rho$, the conduction
velocity $v$, the number of fibers per unit length $n(z_n)$ for each
measurement location\ $z_n$, and the spatial derivative of the membrane voltage
$\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}z}V(z_1,t_m)$ at electrode location $z_1$ for each
time point\ $t_m$. We fit the first derivative of the membrane potential in
order to better capture the low-frequency components that we found in
@fig:simpletree E, and because the membrane potential only appears as the
derivative in the model. The derivative of the membrane voltage at the other
locations was then determined by the traveling-wave assumption: $\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}z}V(z_n,t_m) =
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}z}V(z_1,t_m-\frac{z_n-z_1}{v})$, using a linear interpolation between timepoints.
The model assumption of a single line of axons with electrodes at a fixed
distance is a simplification of a three-dimensional axon tree where the fibers
are distributed at various distances. The distance parameter $\rho$ can be
interpreted as an average distance in this simplification.

To aid the convergence of the fit algorithm, an
initial guess for the number of fibers $n(z_z)$ was set by hand.
Initializing the guess to a constant or a fully random number of fibers resulted in
a failure to converge. However, Gaussian-like initial guesses converged
to a single solution, meaning that the specific initial guess did
not alter the final fit result. The results shown in @fig:barnowl were obtained with
an initial guess of a Gaussian with amplitude 12, centered at penetration depth
725 µm with standard deviation 400 µm.

Because of the linearity of equations 1-4 both in the current $I$ and the
membrane potential $V$, inferring the membrane voltage $V$ from the average
over trials of the EFP $\phi$ produces the average membrane voltage $V$. This
in turn is the membrane voltage response of a single spike convolved with the
peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH).
