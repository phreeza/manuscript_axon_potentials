title: Extracellular potentials generated by axonal projections are shaped by patterns of bifurcations and terminations

date: \today
...

Introduction
==============
Extracellular field potentials (EFPs) are at the heart of many experimental
methods used to examine the inner workings of the brain.  This includes
invasively recorded signals such as Local Field Potentials (LFP), Current Source Density
(CSD) and Multiunit Activity (MUA) as well as the noninvasively recorded 
Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocorticogram (ECoG) and auditory
brainstem response (ABR) [@Brette2012Handbook; @Nunez2006Electric]. The origins
of these EFPs, especially in cases in which the activity is not clearly
attributable to a single cell, is a matter of debate.

EFPs in the brain were long thought to be primarily synaptic in origin
[@Buzsaki2012Origin]. As a consequence, many modeling studies focussed on the
extracellular fields induced by synaptic currents on the dendrites and the soma
of a postsynaptic neuron [@Gold2006Origin; @Holt1999Electrical;
@Einevoll2013Modelling; @Linden2011Modeling; @Linden2010Intrinsic;
@FernandezRuiz2013Cytoarchitectonic]. However, a number of recent data analysis
and modeling efforts have revealed that active, non-synaptic membrane currents
can play an important role in generating EFPs [@Reimann2013Biophysically;
@Anastassiou2015Cell; @Schomburg2012Spiking; @Ray2011Different;
@Belluscio2012CrossFrequency], including far reaching potentials detectable at
the scalp [@Telenczuk2011Highfrequency; @Telenczuk2015Correlates]. However,
currents from the axon are still thought to be so small as to be of minor
importance for the EFP.

One of the reasons for the traditional assumption that axonal currents
contribute little to the EFP is that the far field of an action potential
traveling along an idealized straight axon is quadrupolar, meaning that its far
field decays faster with distance than synaptic sources, which are thought to
be dipolar [@Nunez2006Electric]. However, in experimental studies that recorded
the EFP of axonal responses, the EFP often has a dipolar structure. For
example, @Blot2014Ultrarapid report an EFP with the characteristic dipolar
structure recorded from the vicinity of cerebellar Purkinje cell axons.
@Swadlow2002Activation showed the field potentials due to single
thalamocortical afferents in the rabbit somatosensory cortex. Here the axonal
EFP was distinguished from the synaptic contribution by a difference in timing
and the invariance of the amplitude under different interspike intervals. In
this study the axonal part of the EFP also showed a polarity reversal as
associated with a dipolar source in several of the examples shown. In the
results section we will present a further new example of such a field potential
from the auditory brainstem of the barn owl.

This discrepancy between theory and experiment raises the open question of how
axons are able to generate dipolar field potentials.

The aim of this study is to show how dipolar far fields in the EFP of axons can
be explained by the axons' anatomical structure. In particular, we show that
the branchings and terminations of axons in their projection area lead to
a dipolar EFP structure. Such axon bundles, often also called nerves or
fascicles, exist throughout the peripheral and central nervous system of most
animals [@kandel2000principles; @Hentschel1999Models; @Nornes1972Temporal;
@Goodman1984Cell]. The white matter of the mammalian brain can be viewed as an
agglomeration of such bundles [@Schuz2002Human]. We therefore predict
pronounced contributions of nerves or fascicles to EFPs, which are neglected in
all current models.

Properties of the EFP due to axonal projections are first investigated by
a numerical model based on forward simulation [@Holt1999Electrical;
@Gold2006Origin]. This first model includes a large-scale multicompartment
model of the axon population. We then show a concrete example of the effects in
experimental data using as a set of multi-site in-vivo electrophysiological
recordings from the barn owl brain stem. Finally, we outline the mechanisms
underlying the observed effects by means of a second, analytically tractable,
model of a generic axon bundle. 

Results
==============

*Effects of axonal morphologies on extracellular action potentials*
In order to understand the way that common anatomical structures affect the
extracellular waveform associated with a single action potential, we simulated
simple axons that showed isolated instances of these features in order to
inspect their contributions to the EFP. We began by simulating an infinitely long axon
following a straight line path, neither bifurcating nor terminating
([@fig:simpletree]A). The extracellular action potential has the characteristic
triphasic shape. As the action potential travels from top to bottom, the
waveform is translated in time with the conduction velocity, but is otherwise
unchanged.

Next we simulated the response of an axon that terminates ([@fig:simpletree]B).
Here the approaching action potential (top traces) can be seen to have the
same, triphasic shape as in the non-branching case. When it approaches the
termination, it gradually deforms into a biphasic response, with the positive
peak preceding the negative peak.

The other structure commonly found in axons is a bifurcation. We simulated
a single axon which bifurcates three times on each branch within a distance of
50 $\mu$m, leading to a total number of 8 fibers leaving the bifurcation zone
([@fig:simpletree]C). The potential near this bifurcating axon also has a more
biphasic shape. There is a small initial peak, but the response is dominated by
the second, negative and the third, positive peak. This can be understood by
comparing the shape to the previous example along a non-bifurcating axon: The
initial peak resembles the non-bifurcating case, because the action potential
is still mainly within the segments before the bifurcation. As the action
potential passes the bifurcation, there are now several instances of the action
potential, and the second and third peak are multiplied in size, leading to the
more biphasic response. In the case of a single bifurcation, this effect is
also present, but the amplification of the second and third peak relative to
the first peak is not as notable as in this example.

To understand how bifurcations and terminations interact when they are present
in the same axon, we simulated an axon with an identical number of bifurcations
as in the previous case, but then added terminations to all the fibers 200
$\mu$m after the bifurcation zone ([@fig:simpletree]D). We found that this
leads to the same biphasic responses observed as observed in the cases of the
isolated anatomical features, with the triphasic response occurring briefly
in-between the two features.

In the next step we considered a population of axons with slightly altered
characteristics. The basic structure for each axon in the population was
the same as in [@fig:simpletree]D, but we randomly perturbed the precise
locations of each bifurcation and termination in the tree. We then stimulated
the axons with a simulated spike train containing a pulse of activity. The
resultin extracellular potential showed a polarity reversal similar to that
seen in the single axon potentials, with the difference that at the center of
the projection zone, the average response decreases in amplitude.

A notable point here is that the potential at the single-axon bifurcation and
termination are similar in shape, but opposite in polarity. The same is
observed for the population response. This is similar to the polarity reversal
associated with a dipole observed in experimental studies
(@Swadlow2002Activation; @Blot2014Ultrarapid; this study).

*Axonal projections generate a dipole-like field potential.* To understand how
axons can generate a dipolar EFP, we simulated a parallel fiber bundle that at
first runs at constant diameter without bifurcations and then reaches
a projection zone. Within this projection zone, the fibers first bifurcate,
which increases the number of fibers. Finally, the axons reach a termination
zone, in which the number of fibers decreases to zero ([@fig:bigtree]A).

The spiking activity of a generic axon bundle was simulated by stimulating the
fibers with a background spontaneous firing rate of 100 spikes/second, upon
which a pulse of increased activity was added. This pulse of activity could
relate to any kind of evoked activity in the nervous system, such as a sensory
stimulation, motor activity or a spontaneous transient increase in population
spiking activity. We chose a gaussian pulse with an amplitude of 2900
spikes/second and a standard deviation of 2.8 ms.

trials.](../figs/fig_1_nocsd.pdf){#fig:simpletree}

To characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the evoked EFP, the potential
was calculated for several locations along the axon trunk. Because we first
want to study the effect of the rate pulse on the EFP, we low-pass filtered the
EFP responses with a cut-off frequency of 1 kHz ([@fig:bigtree]B). The
distribution of maximum amplitudes of these responses are shown by the  colored
contour lines in [@fig:bigtree]A and the colored traces in [@fig:bigtree]B.
Surrounding the projection zone of the axon bundle, amplitudes show the
double-lobed shape typical of a dipole.

In [@fig:bigtree]B, all the responses showed a biphasic deflection that was elicited
by the population firing rate pulse. This deflection was visible at all
recording locations. The biphasic deflection reverses polarity in the middle of
the bifurcation zone of the bundle (red box in [@fig:bigtree]B). The polarity
reversal occurs by a decrease of the amplitude to zero and subsequent
reappearance with reversed polarity, as opposed to a polarity reversal through
a gradual shift in phase. This behaviour is also typical for a dipolar field
potential.

The point of the polarity reversal coincides roughly with the middle of the
projection zone. This means that the absolute value of the response amplitude
reaches a local minimum just when the number of axonal fibers reaches a
maximum. To better understand how anatomical features and response amplitude
are related, we compared the signed maximum value (meaning the *signed* value
corresponding to the maximum *absolute* amplitude) of the EFP (red line in
[@fig:bigtree]C) with the difference in the density of branchings and
terminations (black histogram in [@fig:bigtree]C).

Along the nerve trunk the fiber density is constant. As the axon bundle reaches
its projection zone, the number of bifurcations increases. In the middle of the
projection zone, the number of bifurcations and terminations cancels out. At
the same depth, the amplitude of the low-frequency component crosses zero.  As
the end of the projection zone approaches, the terminations outweigh the
bifurcations. As the axon bundle ends, there are no longer any bifurcations or
terminations, and the density decays toward zero. Overall, the amplitude of the
maximum response (red trace) follows the distribution of branchings and
terminations (black histogram). 

The progression of amplitudes in the low-frequency components seen in
[@fig:bigtree]C is also visible in [@fig:bigtree]B, most clearly in the first
column. The polarity reversal in the red box in [@fig:bigtree]B corresponds to
the crossing of zero amplitude in figure [@fig:bigtree]C.

<!--To better understand the relationship between axonal anatomy and this spatial
structure of the EFP, we plotted the change in density of the bundle, meaning
the number of terminations subtracted from the number of bifurcations at a
given 

The low-frequency component shows a distinct relationship to the anatomy: it
appears to be governed by the local density of bifurcations and terminations.
Along the nerve trunk the fiber density is constant, and the low frequency
component is unchanged. As the axon bundle reaches its projection zone, the
number of bifurcations increases, and the low frequency component increases in
amplitude. In the middle of the projection zone, the number of bifurcations and
terminations cancels out.  Correspondingly, the low-frequency component
amplitude reaches a local minimum.  As the end of the projection zone
approaches, the terminations outweigh the bifurcations, and the amplitude
increases, but the polarity is reversed (red box in [@fig:bigtree]B). As the
axon bundle ends, there are no longer any bifurcations or terminations, and the
amplitude decays.

The same distribution of maximum amplitudes for the high-frequency component,
shown in [@fig:bigtree]D, did not show the same lobed shape. Instead it decayed
much faster with distance in both axial and radial direction. This was also
reflected in the waveforms (Fig 1E). There is an increase in amplitude due to
the firing rate pulse at locations close to the nerve bundle, but at locations
further away from the trunk it is no longer distinguishable from the background
activity.-->

To understand the contributions related to individual spikes, we next turned
our attention to the high-frequency range. We calculated the Multi-Unit
Activity (MUA) of the response (see Methods), which reflects the high-frequency
(>1kHz) components of the response, and is thought to reflect spiking activity
in extracellular recordings. The MUA did not show a double-lobe, but rather
appeared like an ellipsoid centered at the projection zone ([@fig:bigtree]D).

The waveform of the MUA response was not modulated heavily in space, with the
exception of the scaling of the amplitude ([@fig:bigtree]E). The amplitude
decays with radial distance from the trunk. The amplitude reaches its maximum
at the middle of the fiber bundle.

The longitudinal behaviour is further examined in [@fig:bigtree]F. The
amplitude of the MUA component (red trace) changes its amplitude in the
longitudinal direction in accordance to the local fiber density (black
histogram). It has an approximately constant amplitude along the nerve trunk
and then increases in amplitude as the fiber density is increased by
bifurcations. As the fibers terminate and fiber density decreases, so does the
amplitude of the MUA.

We have thus shown a qualitatively different behaviour in the low- and
high-frequency components of the EFP. Both appear to be related to anatomy,
though each in a different way.  Together, these relationships suggest that the
particular branching and terminating structure of the axon bundle gives rise to
the dipolar field potential. Because dipolar fields are associated with
a longer spatial reach than the quadrupolar fields typically associated with
axonal spikes, we decided to investigate the effect that axon structure has on
the spatial reach of the frequency components ([@fig:distscaling]). To do this
we performed a further simulation of an axon bundle, this time omitting the
bifurcations, and letting the fibers terminate directly. In axial direction,
the low-frequency component has a further reach than the high frequency
component in the bifurcating case ([@fig:distscaling]A), but not in the
non-bifurcating case ([@fig:distscaling]C).  In the radial direction, the
situation is different: the bifurcating ([@fig:distscaling]B) and
non-bifurcating ([@fig:distscaling]D) case both show a faster decay of the
high-frequency component than of the low-frequency component. To assure that
the effect was due to the bifurcations themselves and not due to the fanned out
structure of the bifurcating bundle seen in [@fig:distscaling]A and
[@fig:distscaling]D, we here changed the layout of both bundles to have
constant widths.

![Low-frequency component of the axon bundle EFP exceeds high-frequency
component in reach, modulated by axon structure. All plots show the scaling of
the low-frequency (blue lines) and high-frequency (green lines) frequency
components on a doubly-logarithmic scale. Amplitudes were normalized to unit
value at the end of the tuft in axial direction (**A** and **B**) and from the
trunk in radial direction (**C** and **D**). **A** and **C** show the behaviour
in the case of a bifurcating bundle, while **B** and **D** show the
nonbifurcating case. In the bifurcating case, the low-frequency component
exceeds the reach of the high-frequency comonent in both directions. In the
non-bifurcating case, the decay is the same for both components in the axial
direction. The scaling behaviours are consistent with the presence of
a low-frequency dipole-like potential in the bifurcating bundle but not in the
non-bifurcating bundle.](../figs/fig_3.pdf){#fig:distscaling}

*The barn owl neurophonic as an example that shows these properties.* In order
to test our model of the extracellular field of axon bundles, we compared it to
recordings from the barn owl auditory brain stem.

We adjusted the model parameters to match the anatomy and physiology of nucleus
laminaris (NL), and set the activation statistics to match measured PSTHs in
response to stimulation by a click sound presented to one ear. We then
simulated the resulting EFP at varying depths, corresponding to recording
depths in the experiment. The resulting recordings from experiment and
simulation are shown in [@fig:barnowl].

The simulated EFPs showed several characteristics that are also observed in the
data.  Firstly, the high-frequency component shows a steady increase in latency
along the projections' depth, and has its maximum in amplitude in the middle of
NL.  The low-frequency component reverses polarity along the depth of NL, and
almost vanishes in the middle of NL. This is the same behaviour as shown for
the generic axon bundle in the previous section.

afferent axon bundle. The low-frequency components (**A** and **C**) show the
polarity reversal. The high frequency component (**B** and **D**), does not
show such a reversal, but rather shows a steady increase in phase with
depth.](../figs/fig_4.pdf){#fig:barnowl}

Discussion
==============
Based on numerical simulations, analytical calculations and experimental data,
we show that axonal fiber bundles can contribute significantly to the EFP, and
how the contributions are shaped by axonal morphology. We characterize three
principal effects of axon bundle structure on the EFP. Firstly, the
low-frequency components of the EFP are governed by the densities of
bifurcations and terminations and can have a dipolar structure. Secondly, the
high-frequency components are governed by the local fiber density. Furthermore
we show that the low-frequency components exceed the high-frequency components
in spatial reach. In particular, the dipolar low-frequency components exceed
the reach of the presumed quadrupolar nature of axonal EFPs.

The two frequency components show qualitatively different behaviour across
recording locations. The low-frequency component is a largely
stationary phenomenon, while the high-frequency component is shifted in space
according to the axonal conduction velocity. Due to the difference in reach,
the high-frequency component is most suitable for the study of local phenomena,
while the low-frequency component can radiate to more distant recording
locations.

These findings relate to the interpretation of a wide range of
electrophysiological data. Heuristics which are valid for the analysis of EFPs
of synaptic, dendritic, or somatic currents may not be valid for axon bundles.
When performing a typical current source density analysis, the underlying
assumption is that the local fiber density is constant among recording
locations, while the membrane voltage varies with time and location
independently. In the case of an axonal fiber bundle as discussed here, the
opposite is the case: fiber density is variable in space, in particular in the
projection zone, but the membrane voltage is highly correlated over space and
time.

<!--TODO: adapt this paragraph for new context -->
It is interesting to note that a similar reversal of polarity in NL has been
reported for chicken [@Schwarz1992Can], as well as in the mammalian analog to
NL, the medial superior olive [@Laughlin2010Oscillatory]. The phase reversal in
this case has been modeled based on the assumption that the postsynaptic NL and
MSO dendrites with their bipolar morphology have a dipolar EFP response
[@Laughlin2010Oscillatory; @Goldwyn2014Model]. However, in the owl this dipolar
morphology is largely absent [@carr90], making dendritic sources unlikely.
Methods
==============

Experimental recordings
-----------------------


Numerical model
---------------------

We modeled the axons using NEURON [@Hines1997NEURON; @Hines2009NEURON] in a model based on previous work by
(**refs**), including the high and low threshold potassium channels used by (**refs**).
The axon was modeled as a sequence of active nodes and passive myelinated
segments. Unlike previous models, we included branching axons
in our simulations. These were generated by connecting two passive segments to
a node, and continuing the alternation of active and passive segment in each
resulting branch.

Action potentials were initiated in the axons by injecting a current pulse into
the first node of Ranvier of the axon. The times of the injections were chosen by
drawing from an inhomogeneous Poisson distribution based on the firing
statistics of NM units in response to a given stimulus.

- Split barn owl and general axon bundle

Axon branching patterns were generated procedurally, **better wording** starting with the root
segment, placed at the border of NL. In order to avoid artifacts from the
current pulse injection and to simulate the fiber tract leading up to NL, a
sequence of 10 active and passive segments without bifurcations was added
before the root. To this root, segments were appended iteratively. Before
adding a segment, a decision whether to branch or terminate an axon was drawn
from a probability distribution dependent on the dorsoventral depth of the end
of the previous segment. These probability distributions were modeled as
logistic functions with the parameters adjusted to roughly match the numbers of
branchings and terminations found in the tracings shown in publications such as
@carr90. This meant that an initial phase of bifurcations was followed
by a phase of terminations, with the probability of termination reaching 100\%
at the end of NL.

The simulations of these axons yielded the membrane currents, from which we
calculated the extracellular fields. The procedure for this is described in
detail by @Gold2006Origin, among others. Briefly, the extracellular medium is
assumed to be a homogeneous volume conductor with conductivity $\sigma_e$, and a quasi-static approximation
of the electrical field potential $\phi$ is made. The extracellular potential
due to a current distribution $I(\mathbf{r},t)$ is then governed by the
equation $\Delta \phi = \frac{1}{\sigma_e} I(\mathbf{r},t)$, with $\Delta$
denoting the Laplace operator. If the currents $I$ are constrained to a volume
$V$, this equation has the solution:
\begin{equation}
  \phi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{V}\frac{I(\mathbf{r}',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}\textrm{d}\mathbf{r}'
  \label{eqn:basic}
\end{equation}
Since the currents though the myelinated segments were negligible, and the
nodes of Ranvier are small, we used the point source approximation of only the
node currents, and did not include the line source approximation used by @Holt1999Electrical.

Simplified axon bundle model
----------------------------

\label{sec:efpresp}
We define the spatial dimension in cylindrical coordinates
$\mathbf{r}=(\rho,\varphi,z)$. We further define $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{z}$ as the
unit vector in $z$ direction, and $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\rho}$ as an arbitrary
unit vector perpendicular to the $z$ direction.

Let us consider a simple model axon bundle that extends infinitely in $z$
direction and lays at 0 in the remaining coordinates. The bundle has a variable
number of fibers along the $z$ axis, denoted by $n(z)$. We assume the axons to
be perfect transmission lines, meaning that the action potential acts like a
travelling wave with velocity $v$ along the axon. This means that the membrane
potential $V$ obeys the following identity at any point:

$$\frac{dV}{dz} = \frac{1}{v}\frac{dV}{dt}$$

In particular, we neglect any delays and distortions which can be induced when
an axon branches or terminates. From a given distribution of membrane
potentials $V$ we can then derive the membrane currents flowing at a given
location:
\begin{align}
I(z,t)& = \frac{d}{dz}\left(n(z)\frac{d}{dz}V(z,t)\right)\\
&= \frac{dn}{dz}(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v}\frac{dV}{dt}(z,t)-n(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{d^2V}{dt^2}(z,t)
\end{align}

Applying this membrane current to equation \ref{eqn:basic}, the corresponding
extracellular field potential $\Phi(\mathbf{r},t)$ of a given $V$ propagating
through such an axon bundle is then 

\begin{align} \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) &
=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{V}\frac{\delta(\rho')I(z',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}\textrm{d}\mathbf{r}'\label{eq:halfline}\\
&
=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{I(z',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-z'\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{z}|}\textrm{d}z'
\end{align} 

Due to the rotational symmetry, the kernel at a distance $\rho$ from the axon bundle,
regardless of $\varphi$, can then be described by \begin{align}
\label{eqn:infkern} \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) &
=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{I(z',t)}{|(z-z')\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{z}
+ \rho\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\rho}|}\textrm{d}z' \\ &
=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{I(z',t)}{\sqrt{(z-z')^2
+ \rho^2}}\textrm{d}z' \end{align}

Equation \ref{eqn:infkern} has the form of a convolution with a weighting
function $w$: \begin{equation} w(\rho,z) =
\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_e}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+\rho^2}} \label{eqn:weighting}
\end{equation}

The convolution can then be written as:

\begin{equation} \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) =
\left[I(z,t)\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z \end{equation}

with the operator $\left[\cdot\ast\cdot\right]_z$ denoting the convolution with
respect to the variable $z$.

* Show how a dipole emerges in simple case
* Flesh out frequency response
* Can the inverse problem be solved ($v$,$n$,$V$)?

$$\tilde{I}(z,\omega) = i\frac{dn}{dz}(z)\cdot\frac{\omega}{v}\tilde{V}(z,\omega)-n(z)\cdot\frac{\omega^2}{v^2}\tilde{V}(z,\omega)$$
$$\left|\tilde{I}(z,\omega)\right| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dn}{dz}(z)\right)^2+\left(n(z)\cdot\frac{\omega}{v}\right)^2}\cdot\frac{\omega}{v}\left|\tilde{V}(z,\omega)\right|$$
