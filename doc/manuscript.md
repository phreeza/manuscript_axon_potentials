title: Extracellular potentials generated by axonal projections are shaped by patterns of bifurcations and terminations

date: \today

abstract: Extracellular field potentials are an important source of information in neuroscience. Despite sustained efforts to understand their physiological basis, the origins of the extracellular field potentials in the brain are in many cases still a matter of debate. Axonal sources are frequently discounted in the interpolation of data, and rarely included in models. In this study, we experimentally and theoretically examined the contributions of axons to extracellular field potentials. We first used a detailed biophysical model as well as a simplified analytical model. Both models showed strong and far reaching contributions to the extracellular field potential. The contributions were especially strong when there was a zone in which the axons branch and terminate in close succession. This type of axonal structure is found in many brain regions and referred to as a terminal zone. Our models predicted a strong dipolar component originating from these structures, including a characteristic polarity reversal at the center of the terminal zone. We tested this prediction using data obtained from the barn owl auditory brainstem. Axons in the nucleus laminaris form stereotypical terminal zones and the extracellular potential is particularly strong. We recorded the responses to monaural acoustic clicks at different locations throughout nucleus laminaris using a multielectrode array. The data showed the spatiotemporal structure of the potentials to be in accordance with our models. Together, these results demonstrate that axons contribute more to extracellular field potentials in the brain than previously thought.

Introduction
==============
Extracellular field potentials (EFPs) are at the heart of many experimental
approaches used to examine the inner workings of the brain.  These are
invasively recorded signals such as the electrocorticogram (ECoG), the local field
potential (LFP), the current source density (CSD), and the multiunit activity (MUA) as
well as the noninvasively recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) and the auditory
brainstem response (ABR) [@Brette2012Handbook; @Nunez2006Electric]. The origins
of these signals, especially in cases in which the activity is not clearly
attributable to a single cell, is a matter of debate [@Buzsaki2012Origin].

EFPs in the brain were long thought to be primarily of synaptic origin
[@Buzsaki2012Origin]. As a consequence, many modeling studies focussed on the
extracellular fields induced by postsynaptic currents on the dendrites and the soma
of a neuron [@Gold2006Origin; @Holt1999Electrical;
@Einevoll2013Modelling; @Linden2011Modeling; @Linden2010Intrinsic;
@FernandezRuiz2013Cytoarchitectonic]. However, a number of recent data analyses
and modeling efforts have revealed that active, non-synaptic membrane currents
can play an important role in generating EFPs [@Reimann2013Biophysically;
@Anastassiou2015Cell; @Schomburg2012Spiking; @Ray2011Different;
@Belluscio2012CrossFrequency], including far reaching potentials detectable at
the scalp [@Telenczuk2011Highfrequency; @Telenczuk2015Correlates]. However,
currents from the axon are still thought to be so small as to be of minor
importance for the EFP.

One of the reasons for the assumption that axonal currents contribute little to
the EFP is that the far field of an action potential traveling along an
idealized straight axon is quadrupolar, meaning that it decays faster with
distance than synaptic sources, which are typically dipolar
[@Nunez2006Electric]. However, in experimental studies that recorded the EFP of
axonal responses, the EFP can also have a dipolar structure. For example,
@Blot2014Ultrarapid recorded from the vicinity of cerebellar Purkinje cell
axons and reported an EFP with a characteristic dipolar structure.
@Swadlow2002Activation showed that the axonal part of the EFP of
thalamocortical afferents showed a polarity reversal as associated with a
dipolar source. Classical current source density studies found dipolar current
distributions in axonal terminal zones in the cortex and lateral geniculate
nucleus, and attributed these to axons by means of conduction velocity
estimation [@Mitzdorf1985Current]. Here we we present a
further well developed example of a dipolar, axonal field potential from the auditory
brainstem of the barn owl.

This discrepancy between the quadrupolar structure of EFPs generated by
idealized axons, as predicted by theory, and the experimentally observed
dipolar structure, raises the question of how axons are able to generate
dipolar field potentials. We show how dipolar far fields in the EFP of axons
can be explained by the axons' anatomical structure. In particular, we show
that the branchings and terminations of axons in their terminal zone area lead
to a dipolar EFP structure. Such axon bundles, often also called 
fascicles, exist throughout the peripheral and central nervous system [@kandel2000principles; @Hentschel1999Models; @Nornes1972Temporal;
@Goodman1984Cell]. The white matter of the mammalian brain can be viewed as an
agglomeration of such bundles [@Schuz2002Human]. We therefore predict
pronounced contributions of nerves or fascicles to EFPs, which are neglected in
almost all current models.

In what follows, properties of the EFP due to axonal projections are first
investigated by a numerical model based on forward simulation
[@Holt1999Electrical; @Gold2006Origin]. This first model includes a large-scale
multicompartment model of an axon population. We then outline the mechanisms
underlying the observed effects by means of a second, analytically tractable,
model of a generic axon bundle. Finally, we show a concrete example of the
effects in experimental data using as a set of multi-site in-vivo
electrophysiological recordings from the barn owl brain stem.

Results
==============

Effects of axonal bifurcations and terminations on extracellular action potentials
----

To understand how the geometry of an axon affects the extracellular waveform
associated with action potentials, we numerically simulated single action
potentials propagating along generic axons and calculated their contribution to
the EFP along the axon. We began by simulating an
infinitely long axon following a straight line path, neither bifurcating nor
terminating ([@fig:simpletree]A). The extracellular action potential has the
characteristic triphasic shape. As the action potential travels from top to
bottom, the waveform is translated in time with the conduction velocity, but is
otherwise unchanged.

There are two ways of understanding the triphasic shape of the extracellular
waveform. The first is by attribution of the peaks of the response to
individual current types. The first, positive peak corresponds to the capacitive
current, the large second peak to the sodium current, and the final peak to the
potassium current [@Gold2006Origin]. A second, more mathematical approach is specific to the
nature of the axon. Due to Kirchoff's law and cable theory (see Methods), the local
transmembrane current in an axon is proportional to the second spatial derivative
of the membrane potential along the direction of the axon. Because the action
potential is roughly a travelling wave, the currents are also proportional to
the second *temporal* derivative of the membrane potential. The three extrema of the EFP
are thus related to the points of maximum curvature in the action potential
waveform, namely the onset, the maximum, and the end of the spike.

Next we simulated the response of an axon that terminates ([@fig:simpletree]B).
Here the approaching action potential (top traces) has the same, triphasic
shape as in the non-branching case. When the action potential reaches the
termination point, it gradually deforms into a biphasic response, with a
positive peak preceding a negative peak. The mechanism for this deformation can
be understood as follows: As the action potential approaches the recording
location next to the termination, the majority of the currents flow at points
located before the termination, and are identical to those in the
non-terminating case; the first peak is not affected. The second and third peak
of the extracellular action potential in the non-terminating case are generated
by currents close to or after the electrode location. In the terminating
axon, the currents at points after the termination are no longer present,
leading to a partial suppression of the second peak and a complete suppression
of the third peak at locations after the termination.

Another generic structure found in axons is a bifurcation. We simulated
a single axon that bifurcates three times on each branch within a distance of
50 $\mu$m, leading to a total number of 8 fibers leaving the bifurcation zone
([@fig:simpletree]C). The EFP near this bifurcation zone also has a biphasic
shape. Although there is an initial small positive peak, the response is
dominated by the second, negative and the third, positive peak. This waveform
can again be understood by comparison to the first example containing the
infinitely long axon: The initial peak resembles the infinite case, because
most of the action potential-related currents are flowing within the part of
the axon before the bifurcation. As the action potential passes the bifurcation
zone, it multiplies and there are now several action potentials (one in each
fiber). Because of the active nature of the action potential, the currents are
also multiplied and sum up across the fibers. This leads the second and third
peak to be multiplied in size, yielding a more biphasic response. We chose to
simulate several bifurcations because this leads to a clearer effect in the
EFP. In the case of a single bifurcation, this effect is also present, but the
amplification of the second and third peak relative to the first peak is not as
notable as in this example.

To understand how bifurcations and terminations interact when they are present
in the same axon, we simulated an axon with an identical number of bifurcations
as in the previous case, but then added terminations to all the fibers 200
$\mu$m after the bifurcation zone ([@fig:simpletree]D). We found that this
configuration leads to the same biphasic responses as observed in the cases of
the isolated anatomical features. A triphasic response occurred in-between the
bifurcation and termination zones. A notable point here is that the potential
at the bifurcation and termination are both biphasic and on the same timescale,
but opposite in polarity. 

Moving towards more biologically plausible axon geometries, we next considered
a population of axons with slightly altered characteristics. The basic
structure for each axon in the population was the same as in
[@fig:simpletree]D, but we randomly perturbed the precise locations of
bifurcations and terminations in the axon tree ([@fig:simpletree]E, left). We
furthermore stimulated each axon with an inhomogeneous Poisson spike train. The
driving rate of the inhomogeneous Poisson process was the same for all axons
and was consisted of a constant background rate and a Gaussian pulse of
heightened activity. The resulting extracellular waveforms ([@fig:simpletree]E,
right) showed a polarity reversal similar to that seen in the single action
potential and axon EFP ([@fig:simpletree]D). In the bifurcation zone, the
summed contribution from many fibers and action potentials lead to a monophasic
negative peak, and in the termination zone there was a monophasic positive
peak, due to the differences in exact spike timings across fibers.
Interestingly, the summed potential at the center of the terminal zone largely
cancelled out.

The reversal behaviour shown in [@fig:simpletree]E is similar to the polarity
reversal associated with a dipole observed in experimental studies
(@Swadlow2002Activation; @Blot2014Ultrarapid; this study). To summarize,
simple model axon structures can produce complex and diverse spatiotemporal
responses comparable to some experimental responses.

Axonal projections generate a dipole-like field potential
-----

To understand how axons can generate a dipolar EFP, we simulated a
parallel fiber bundle that at first runs at constant diameter without
bifurcations and then reaches a terminal zone. Within this terminal zone,
the fibers first bifurcate, which increases the number of fibers. Finally, as the
axons reach the end of the terminal zone, and the number of fibers decreases to zero
([@fig:bigtree]A). To model more closely the actual axonal structures found in
nature, we also extended the model axons to include a radial fanning out of the
branches, as well as a more diverse set of morphologies including a variable
number of bifurcations and terminations (see Materials and Methods for details).

The spiking activity of a generic axon bundle was simulated by stimulating
fibers that had a background spontaneous firing rate of 100 spikes/s with a
pulse of increased activity. We chose a Gaussian pulse with an amplitude of
2900 spikes/s and a standard deviation of 2.8 ms. These numbers are
motivated by the early auditory system
[@koppl97a;@Sullivan1984Segregation;@Konishi1985Owls]. However, our approach is
not limited to the auditory system (which would also require to include phase
locking), and this pulse of activity could relate to various kinds of evoked
activity in the nervous system, such as sensory stimulation, motor activity
or a spontaneous transient increase in population spiking activity.

To characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the evoked EFP, the time course
of the potential was calculated for several locations along the axon trunk. We
divided our analysis into 2 frequency bands by filtering the responses. These
frequency components are sometimes referred to as the LFP and the MUA (see
Materials and Methods).

Because we first wanted to study the effect of the Gaussian rate pulse on the EFP, we
low-pass filtered the EFP responses with a cut-off frequency of 1\ kHz
([@fig:bigtree]B). This filtering removed most of the contributions of individual spikes,
while a population-level signal remained. The distribution of maximum
amplitudes of these responses are shown by the  colored contour lines in
[@fig:bigtree]A and the colored voltage traces in [@fig:bigtree]B. Surrounding
the terminal zone of the axon bundle, amplitudes showed a double-lobed
shape that is typical of a dipole.

In [@fig:bigtree]B, the responses mostly showed monophasic deflection that was
elicited by the population firing rate pulse. This deflection was visible at
all recording locations. In the radial direction from the axon tree, i.e. in
horizontal direction in the figure, the amplitude decays. In the axial
direction along the axon tree, ie in vertical direction in the figure, the
voltage deflection reverses polarity in the middle of the terminal zone of the
bundle ([@fig:bigtree]B). The polarity reversal occurs by a decrease of the
amplitude to zero and a subsequent reappearance with reversed polarity (as
opposed to a polarity reversal through a gradual shift in phase). This behaviour
is also typical for a dipolar field potential.

The point of the polarity reversal coincides roughly with the middle of the
terminal zone. This means that the absolute value of the response amplitude
reaches a local minimum just when the number of axonal fibers reaches a
maximum. To better understand how anatomical features and response amplitude
are related, we compared the signed maximum value (meaning the *signed* value
corresponding to the maximum *absolute* amplitude) of the EFP (black line in
[@fig:bigtree]C) with the difference in the number of branchings and
terminations per 200 $\mu$m bin (blue histogram in [@fig:bigtree]C).

Along the nerve trunk the number of fibers is constant. As the axon bundle
reaches its terminal zone, the number of bifurcations increases(blue bars point
right in [@fig:bigtree]C). The increase of bifurcations is followed by an
increase of terminations. In the middle of the terminal zone, the number of
bifurcations and terminations are equal. At the same depth, the amplitude of
the low-frequency component crosses zero.  At the end of the terminal zone, the
terminations outweigh the bifurcations (blue bars point
left in [@fig:bigtree]C). As the axon bundle ends, there are no
longer any bifurcations or terminations, and the number of fibers decays toward
zero. Overall, the amplitude of the maximum response (black trace) follows the
distribution of branchings and terminations (blue histogram). 

The progression of amplitudes in the low-frequency components seen in
[@fig:bigtree]C is also visible in [@fig:bigtree]B, most clearly in the first
column. The polarity reversal in the center of [@fig:bigtree]B corresponds to
the crossing of zero amplitude in figure [@fig:bigtree]C.

<!--To better understand the relationship between axonal anatomy and this spatial
structure of the EFP, we plotted the change in density of the bundle, meaning
the number of terminations subtracted from the number of bifurcations at a
given 

The low-frequency component shows a distinct relationship to the anatomy: it
appears to be governed by the local density of bifurcations and terminations.
Along the nerve trunk the fiber density is constant, and the low frequency
component is unchanged. As the axon bundle reaches its projection zone, the
number of bifurcations increases, and the low frequency component increases in
amplitude. In the middle of the projection zone, the number of bifurcations and
terminations cancels out.  Correspondingly, the low-frequency component
amplitude reaches a local minimum.  As the end of the projection zone
approaches, the terminations outweigh the bifurcations, and the amplitude
increases, but the polarity is reversed (red box in [@fig:bigtree]B). As the
axon bundle ends, there are no longer any bifurcations or terminations, and the
amplitude decays.

The same distribution of maximum amplitudes for the high-frequency component,
shown in [@fig:bigtree]D, did not show the same lobed shape. Instead it decayed
much faster with distance in both axial and radial direction. This was also
reflected in the waveforms (Fig 1E). There is an increase in amplitude due to
the firing rate pulse at locations close to the nerve bundle, but at locations
further away from the trunk it is no longer distinguishable from the background
activity.-->

To understand the EFP contributions related to individual spikes, we next turned
our attention to the high-frequency range. The MUA of the
response, which contains the high-frequency (>1\ kHz) components, is thought
to reflect spiking activity when calculated in extracellular recordings. In out
example in [@fig:bigtree], the MUA did not show a
double-lobe, but rather appeared like an ellipsoid centered at the terminal zone
([@fig:bigtree]D).

The shape of the MUA response was not modulated heavily in space, the main
change across locations lies in the scaling of the amplitude ([@fig:bigtree]E).
The amplitude decays with radial distance from the trunk. In the axial
direction, the amplitude reaches
its maximum at the middle of the fiber bundle.

The axial behaviour is further examined in [@fig:bigtree]F. The
amplitude of the MUA component (black trace) changes its amplitude in the
longitudinal direction in accordance to the local number of fibers (green
histogram). The local number of fibers and the MUA amplitude are both constant
along the nerve trunk. Both measures then increases in amplitude as the number
of fibers is increased by bifurcations. As the fibers terminate and the number
of fibers decreases, so does the amplitude of the MUA.

We have thus shown a qualitatively different behaviour in the low- and
high-frequency components of the EFP, i.e. LFP and MUA. The particular branching
and terminating structure of the axon bundle may thus give rise to a dipolar LFP.

Effects of bifurcations and terminations on distance scaling behaviour of EFPs
--------

Because dipolar fields have a weaker spatial decay than quadrupolar fields,
which are typically associated with axonal spikes, we investigated the effect
of axon structure on the spatial reach of the EFP. Motivated by the
fundamentally different behaviour of the low-frequency LFP and the
high-frequency MUA, we differentiated between these frequency components
([@fig:distscaling]). To do this, we performed further simulations of an axon
bundle. As before, we simulated an axon bundle containing a terminal zone with
bifurcations and terminations. Moreover, as a control, we also simulated an
axon bundle without bifurcations in which a fixed number of fibers arrives and
then terminates.

To avoid confounding effects in the spatial reach of the potentials due to the
specific arrangement of axon branches in a single realization of an axon tree,
and to afford better analytic tractability, we transitioned to a simpler model
of the axon bundle (see Materials and Methods). This model omitted the radial
fanning out of the bundle in the terminal zone used in the simulation of
[@fig:bigtree]. Furthermore, the simplified model discarded the detailed
conductance-based simulation of the membrane potential, and instead assumed a
fixed membrane potential waveform travelling along the axon trunk with constant
propagation velocity. Using linear cable theory, it was then possible to
calculate the membrane currents necessary for determination of the EFP. The
simplified model also allowed us to consider a continuous number of fibers
instead of simulating discrete bifurcations and bifurcations. While highly
simplified, this model captures all effects described for the more complex
model so far. All following simulations are based on this simplified model.

The dipole-like component observed in [@fig:bigtree] had it's dipole axis
aligned with the axon trunk. We therefore expected the field potential to decay
as $r^{-2}$ in this direction, which we call the axial direction. To test
this, we plotted the amplitude of the low-frequency component (<1\ kHz) in axial
direction in [@fig:distscaling]A. The plot is on a double logarithmic scale,
meaning that the slope of the curve corresponds to the scaling exponent, and
the vertical offset corresponds to the amplitude of the component. We observed
$r^{-2}$ scaling for distances larger than the extent of the
bifurcation zone ($\gtrsim 1$\ mm). Interestingly, the amplitude of the low-frequency
component remained an order of magnitude larger in the bifurcating case (solid
line) than in the non-bifurcating case (dashed line).

Next we examined the high-frequency component ([@fig:distscaling]B). Here the
asymptotic scaling was also $r^{-2}$ for axial distances $\gtrsim 1$\ mm, but
the amplitudes were similar between bifurcating and non-bifurcating case. The
difference between the amplitudes of bifurcating and non-bifurcating bundles is
much smaller than in the low-frequency case, even though the difference in
amplitudes was the same at short distances $\lesssim 100$\ $\mu$m. At these
distances, the difference is proportional to the number of fibers, which is
larger in the bifurcating case. To conclude, the terminal zone contributed mainly
to the low-frequency dipole moment of the EFP. Because of this, the magnitude of the
low-frequency component exceeded the magnitude of the high-frequency component
by two orders of magnitude in the far field. 

In contrast to the axial direction, the dipole hypothesis predicts a different
scaling behaviour of the EFP for the radial direction. The dipole component
becomes zero in the direction perpendicular to the dipole axis, and we thus
expected quadrupolar or higher-order scaling behaviour in this case. In
[@fig:distscaling]C we can see that this is indeed the case for the
low-frequency component. The potentials scale as $r^{-3}$, and the difference in
logarithmic amplitude between bifurcating and non-bifurcating case is roughly
the same at all distances. The high-frequency component also decayed as
$r^{-3}$ in the radial direction ([@fig:distscaling]D), but the difference in
logarithmic amplitudes was slightly diminished at larger distances.

To better understand the frequency-specific contributions to the dipole
moments, we calculated the scaling behaviour as a function of frequency. The
amplitude of the dipole moment was determined by fitting a straight line with
slope $-2$ to the double logarithmic scaling of the power spectral density. The
power spectral density was averaged over a frequency band 500\ Hz wide, and the
fit was performed for distances $> 1$\ mm. The value of this straight line at
axial distance 1\ $\mu$m then gave the dipole moments.

These frequency-specific dipole moments are shown in [@fig:distscaling]E. The
dipole moment of the bifurcating case (solid line) has a maximum at around 1
kHz, while in the non-bifurcating case (dashed line) it decays monotonically.
We can see that the dipole moment in the bifurcating case exceeds the
non-bifurcating case for low frequencies. For higher frequencies, the moments
become roughly equal, meaning that they are formed by the incoming fibers, and
the bifurcation zone does not contribute strongly.

As in any multipole expansion, the dipolar component will dominate the EFP at
long distances in all directions except for those perpendicular to the dipole
axis. At shorter distances, as well as in the plane perpendicular to the dipole
axis, the quadrupolar component becomes important. For this reason we performed
the same analysis for the quadrupole moments. This meant fitting a line with
slope -3 instead of -2 to the power spectral density. The resulting quadrupole
moments are shown in [@fig:distscaling]F. The quadrupole moment of the
bifurcating case (solid line) has a maximum at around 2\ kHz, and the
quadrupole moment of the non-bifurcating case (dashed line) is monotonically
decreasing. The moments are increasingly different with increasing frequencies
up to 2\ kHz, after which they approach each other again. As for the dipole
moments, this can be interpreted as a low contribution of the terminal zone to
the high-frequency moments. 

In the bifurcating case, the number of fibers was increased by a factor of 10.
This means that an increase in the moments due to the bifurcations greater than
10 can be called supralinear. In [@fig:distscaling]G we compare this relative
impact of the terminal zone on dipole moments (red line) and quadrupole moments (black
line), by plotting their ratios across frequencies. Here we can see that for
low frequencies, the ratio for the quadrupole moment approaches values lower
than 10, meaning that there is only little additional contribution from the
terminal zone. The dipole moment approaches a factor of 10 for low frequencies,
meaning that the terminal zone contributes in proportion to the number of added
fibers. In both components, the contribution is maximal for intermediate
frequencies, with the maximal dipolar contribution lying at lower frequencies
than the quadrupolar component. For very high frequencies, both contributions
return to values below 10. The terminal zone has a supralinear contribution
(factor greater than 10) for the dipole at frequencies below 3.5\ kHz and for
the quadrupolar component at frequencies between 1 and 4.5\ kHz.

Together, these observations show us that the terminal zone makes a strong
contribution to the far-reaching dipole field potential of the axon bundle. At
somewhat higher frequencies, the more local quadrupolar potential is also
increased.

The barn owl neurophonic potential in nucleus laminaris as an example for a dipolar field in an axonal terminal zone.
----

In order to test predictions of our model of the extracellular field of axon
bundles, we recorded EFP responses from the barn owl auditory brain stem. The
barn owl has a highly developed auditory system with a strong frequency
following response in the EFP in the nucleus laminaris (NL), called the
neurophonic. In NL, the input from the two ears is first integrated to
calculate the azimuthal location of a sound source, and this information is
encoded in the EFP. The EFP in this region is mainly due to the efferent
activity, and the spiking contribution of postsynaptic neurons is minimal
[@Kuokkanen2010Origin;@Kuokkanen2013Linear]. Furthermore, the anatomy of the
efferent axons is well known and follows a stereotypical pattern [@carr90]: Two
fiber bundles enter the nucleus, with fibers from the contralateral ear
entering ventrally, and from the ipsilateral ear entering dorsally. The axon
bundles reach the nucleus from the previous nucleus without bifurcating, then
bifrucate multiple times at the border of the NL, and then terminate within NL.
They have a strong directional preference and run roughly in parallel. This
well studied physiology and anatomy makes the system an ideal candidate to
study the EFPs of axon bundles.

To study the spatiotemporal structure of the EFP in NL, we performed
simultaneous multi-electrode recordings of the response in NL to contralateral
monaural click stimuli. The click responses showed  distinct high- and
low-frequency components as previously reported [@wagner09]. The high-frequency
ringing corresponds to the position on the frequency map within NL being
recorded from and reflects the tuning and phase locking of the incoming axons
to the stimulus frequency. The origin of the low-frequency component remains
unexplained. We filtered the data to roughly separate these components. The
cutoff to split the components was set to 2\ kHz, because this frequency was
always well below the high-frequency ringing component, which usually dominated
the spectra.

The model was fit to the data by performing a nonlinear least squares
optimization. Free parameters were (1) the number of fibers at the depth of each recording
location, (2) the average membrane potential over time in a single fiber at the
location next to the most dorsal electrode, (3) the axonal conduction velocity, and (4)

The resulting EFP responses and the model fit are depicted in [@fig:barnowl].
[@fig:barnowl]A shows the high-frequency ($\geq 2$\ kHz) response. The orange
lines indicate the actual responses in the data. The responses have a
Gabor-like shape, as expected [@wagner09], with maximum amplitude in the center
of the recording array, at around 850\ $\mu$m penetration depth. The velocity
was calculated to be 4.0 m/s. A previously published estimate of the axonal
conduction velocity in this nucleus was 1.6 m/s in @McColgan2014Functional.
Toward the edges (< 100 and > 1400 $\mu$m), the amplitude decays. In the
central region (400-1200\ $\mu$m, a systematic shift in delay can be observed, while the response
seems to be stationary in the more dorsal and ventral electrodes. The delay
increases from ventral to dorsal, which is consistent with the anatomy for
contralateral stimulation. All these aspects of the data are qualitatively reproduced by
the model (purple traces). The main deviation between model and data lies in a
diminished amplitude of the oscillation at the most central electrode
sites. Because the phase shift in the central region is mainly determined by
the conduction velocity, this mismatch might be due to a slightly changing conduction
velocity in the nucleus. A diminished amplitude in the fit could reflect
an inability of the model to exactly match the phase progression. Another possible
explanation is that the additional amplitude could be due to non-axonal sources
such as synaptic currents or postsynaptic spikes, which do not follow the assumptions underlying the
model being fit.

The low-frequency ($30$\ Hz - $2$\ kHz, [@fig:barnowl]B) responses reveal the
typical polarity reversal that we predicted for an axonal terminal zone
(Figures 1 and 2). The responses at the dorsal and ventral edges show the same
shape, but with opposite polarity, as expected for a dipolar field. Note that
for a pure dipole field, the amplitude of the central responses have zero
amplitude. In the data shown here, central responses show a diminished maximum
amplitude, which reveals the contribution of the quadrupole component. The
model is able to capture the behaviour of this quadrupolar component as well, with a slight
underestimation of the amplitude of the peak at ventral locations. The model
even captures a small oscillation in the data with period of
$\approx 1$ ms in the center of the recording. Here, too, the small deviations are likely
due to a slightly inhomogeneous conduction velocity or non-axonal sources.

[@fig:barnowl]C shows the inferred average over trials of the membrane voltage
in response to the stimulus, at a location in the axon next to the first
electrode. The voltage is composed of high- and low-frequency components similar to those
observed in the EFP. When comparing this inferred membrane potential response
to the measured EFP response, the most salient difference is that in the EFP,
the low-frequency component has a comparable amplitude to the high-frequency
component, but in the membrane voltage the low-frequency component is much
larger. This is due to the fact that the second derivative term in the current
equation essentially imposes a high-pass filter on the membrane voltage.

The inferred number of fibers is shown in [@fig:barnowl]D. The density (number
of fibers per unit length) is shown as a function of dorsoventral depth,
meaning that the vertical axis of [@fig:barnowl]A and [@fig:barnowl]B corresponds to
the horizontal axis in [@fig:barnowl]D. The density has its maximum at the center of the
electrode array, and decays steadily to both sides. This profile of the number of fibers
is consistent with the known anatomy of axons in NL. The density does not decay
to zero on either side, which may be due to the limited range of recording
locations. The number of fibers beyond the border of the nucleus in dorsal
direction should be zero, because it is known from anatomy that all fibers
terminate within the nucleus.

Discussion
==============
Based on numerical simulations, analytical calculations and experimental data,
we show how axonal fiber bundles contribute significantly to the EFP, and we
explain how the contributions are shaped by axonal morphology. There are
three principal effects of axon bundle structure on the EFP. Firstly, the
low-frequency components of the EFP are governed by the densities of
bifurcations and terminations and can have a dipolar structure
([@fig:simpletree] and [@fig:bigtree]). Secondly, the high-frequency components
are governed by the local number of fibers ([@fig:bigtree]). Furthermore we
show that the low-frequency components exceed the high-frequency components in
spatial reach. In particular, the dipolar low-frequency components are not
negligible and exceed the reach of the presumed quadrupolar nature of axonal
EFPs ([@fig:distscaling]).

Relevance to interpretation of electrophysiological recordings
----

The low- and high-frequency components show qualitatively different behaviours
across recording locations. The low-frequency component is a largely stationary
phenomenon, while the high-frequency component shifts in space as a function of
the axonal conduction velocity ([@fig:barnowl]). Due to the difference in
reach, the high-frequency component is most suitable for the study of local
phenomena, while the low-frequency component bears information about locations
more distant from the recording site ([@fig:distscaling]).

These findings relate to the interpretation of a wide range of
electrophysiological data. Heuristics that are valid for the analysis of EFPs
of synaptic, dendritic, or somatic currents may not be valid for axon bundles.
When performing a typical current source density analysis, the local number of
fibers cannot be disentangled from membrane current density
[@Nicholson1973Theoretical]. The membrane voltage, and thus the membrane
current densities, can vary with time and location independently. In the case
of an axonal fiber bundle as discussed here, the opposite is the case: the
number of fibers is variable in space, in particular in the terminal zone, but
the membrane voltages are highly correlated over space and time due to the
signal propagation in the axon. The sink and source distribution found in
classical CSD analysis of axon bundles
[@Mitzdorf1978Prominent;@Mitzdorf1985Current;@Mitzdorf1977Laminar], show a
dipolar structure in terminal zones. Our modelling approach provides a novel
way of interpreting these findings.

Dipolar fields also play an important role in the generation of electrical
field potentials at greater distances from the brain. The most prominent of
these is the EEG, which is commonly attributed to the dipolar contributions of
pyramidal cells [@Nunez2006Electric]. We propose that axonal contributions might also be
relevant in the analysis of these fields. This is particularly true for the
auditory brainstem response, which is closely related to the EEG and involves
brain structures that display high degrees of synchrony as well as 
axonal organization, and are thus ideal candidates for
the generation of axonal field potentials visible at long ranges. This would in
turn have implications for the interpretation of the ABR in clinical contexts.

Dipolar EFPs in other animals and brain regions
----

It is interesting to note that a similar dipole-like reversal of polarity as
shown here for the barn owl NL has been reported in the chicken NL
[@Schwarz1992Can], as well as in the mammalian analog to NL, the medial
superior olive [@McLaughlin2010Oscillatory]. The phase reversal in this case has
been modeled based on the assumption that the postsynaptic NL and
MSO dendrites with their bipolar morphology generate the dipolar EFP response
[@McLaughlin2010Oscillatory; @Goldwyn2014Model]. However, in the owl this dipolar
morphology is largely absent [@carr90], making dendritic sources unlikely. This
suggests that similar dipolar field potentials in owls and mammals emerge from
different physiological substrates. Such a convergence might point towards an
evolutionary pressure favouring such an EFP structure in coincidence detection
systems, and indeed @Goldwyn2016Neuronal have proposed a model in which this extracellular
potential enhances the function of coincidence detectors through a form of
ephaptic interaction. Their approach centers on dendrites and is not directly
transferable, but it seems possible that a similar mechanism might arise in the
barn owl NL based on axonal EFPs.

One assumption underlying our modelling of axonal geometries is that there
exists a preferential direction of growth of the axon arbor. In many structures
this is the case, for example in the parts of the auditory brainstem we studied
here. In other brain regions, this tendency is not as prominent, with a
spectrum existing between completely directed and undirected growth. More
undirected growth would lead to a more diffuse response in the EFP, and
eventually to a cancellation of the dipolar field potentials. @Cuntz2010One and
@Budd2010Neocortical studied the principles underlying the growth patterns of
axons and found that the degree of direction in the growth of an axon depends
on the balance struck between conduction delay and wiring cost. Optimizing for
minimal conduction time leads to highly directed structures, while optimizing
wiring cost leads to more tortuous, undirected growth. This leads to the
conclusion that directed structures and thus also strong, dipolar EFPs due to
axons may be more prevalent in systems which require high temporal precision.

Conclusion
----

In conclusion, axonal projections can contribute substantially to EFPs. The
analysis of the responses provides insight into both the underlying anatomy as
well as the activity of axons. Future studies of axonal EFPs will shed light on
the temporal and spatial structure of efferent activity in many brain regions.

Methods
==============

Experimental recordings
-----------------------

The experiments were conducted at the Department of Biology of the University
Maryland. Data was collected from three barn owls (*Tyto furcata pratincola*).
Procedures conformed to NIH Guidelines for Animal Research and were approved by
the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland. Anaesthesia
was induced prior to each experiment by intramuscular injection of a total of
$8-10$ ml/kg of $20\%$ urethane divided into three to four injections over the
course of $3$ hours. Body temperature was maintained at $39^\circ$C by a
feedback-controlled heating blanket.

Recordings were made in a sound-attenuating chamber (Acoustic Systems Inc.,
Austin, TX, USA). Tungsten electrodes with impedances between $2$ and $20$
M$\Omega$ were used to find suitable recording locations in NL. Once NL had
been located, the tungsten electrode was retracted and replaced with a 32 channel
multi-electrode array (A1x32-15mm-50-413-A32, Neuronexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
The multi-electrode array was lowered using a microdrive (MP225, Sutter
Instruments Co., Novato, CA, USA) during continuous presentation of a
white-noise burst stimulus until visual inspection of the waveform showed that
NL was at the center of the array. A grounded silver chloride pellet, placed
under the animal's skin around the incision, served as the reference electrode.
Electrode signals were amplified by a headstage (HS36, Neuralynx Inc., Tucson,
AZ, USA). An adapter (ADPT-HS36-N2T-32A, Neuralynx Inc.) was used between the
electrode and the headstage. A further adapter (ADPT-HS-36-ERP-27, Neuralynx
Inc.) was used between the headstage and the control panel in order to map all 32
channels to the amplifiers. Pre-amplified electrode signals were passed to the
control panel (ERP27, Neuralynx Inc.), then to four 8-channel amplifiers
(Lynx-8, Neuralynx Inc.), and then to an analogue-to-digital converter (Cheetah
Digital Interface, Neuralynx Inc.) connected to a personal computer running
Cheetah5 software (Neuralynx Inc.) where the responses were stored for off-line
analysis.

Acoustic stimuli were digitally generated by a custom-made \textsc{Matlab}
(MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) script driving a signal-processing board (RX6,
Tucker-Davis Techonologies, Alachua, FL, USA) at a sampling rate of 195.3125\ kHz. The sound stimuli
were attenuated using a programmable attenuator (PA5, Tucker-Davis
Techonologies). Click stimuli were generated as a single
half-wave of a 5\ kHz sine tone. Miniature earphones were inserted into the
owl's ear canals and fixed to a headplate. Acoustic stimuli were fed to these
earphones. Stimulus delivery was triggered by National Instruments equipment
(NI USB-6259 and BNC-2090A, National Instruments Inc, Austin, TX, USA), and
stimulus presentation times were recorded along with the responses. Trigger
pulses were configured in \textsc{MatLab} through Ephus software (Vidrio
Technologies LLC, Ashburn, VA, USA).

Numerical model
---------------------

We modeled axons using NEURON [@Hines1997NEURON; @Hines2009NEURON] and extended
previous work by @Kuba2009Roles, which included the high- and low-threshold
potassium channels used by @Rathouz1998Characterization. The axon was modeled
as a sequence of active nodes and passive myelinated segments. The nodes
and myelinated segments had lengths of 2\ $\mu$m and 75\ $\mu$m, respectively. Unlike previous
models, we included branching axons in our simulations. Branches were generated by
connecting two passive segments to a node, and continuing the alternation of
active and passive segments in each resulting branch. In cases where
the positions of bifurcations or terminations were fixed, the last segment
was shortened in order to obtain the total length before the next bifurcation
or termination.

To evoke an action potential at a designated spike time, a special conductance was temporarily activated
in the first node of Ranvier. The conductance had a reversal
potential of 0 mV, a maximal amplitude of 0.05\ $\mu$S, and a time course
described by an alpha-function with time constant 0.01\ ms. Soma and axon
initial segment were not modeled explicitly. 

For the simplified axon geometries used in [@fig:simpletree], the branching
pattern was fixed as described in the caption, with the exception of
the axial position of the branching points in [@fig:simpletree]E, where a random
offset between branching points was drawn from a gamma distribution with mean
400 $\mu$m and standard deviation 300 $\mu$m. The initial branching point was
offset from the original location by a distance drawn from a
Gaussian distribution with mean zero and a standard deviation of 300 $\mu$m.
This was done to smooth out the effects of individual branchings or
terminations and show the population response.

For the axon populations seen in [@fig:bigtree], branching patterns were generated
procedurally, starting with a root segment. In order to avoid artifacts from
the stimulus and to simulate a fiber tract prior to the terminal zone, a
sequence of 10 active and passive segments without bifurcations was assumed
before the terminal zone. To this root, segments were appended iteratively.
Before adding a segment, a decision whether to branch or terminate an axon was
drawn from a probability distribution that was dependent on the axial position of the
end of the previous segment. These probability distributions were modeled as
logistic functions with the parameters adjusted to roughly match the numbers of
branchings and terminations shown by 
@carr90. Thus, an initial phase dominated by bifurcations was followed by a
phase dominated by terminations, with the probability of termination reaching 100\% at
the end of the terminal zone. The distribution of bifurcations had its
maximum at axial location $z=0$ with a standard deviation of 200 $\mu$m. The distribution of
terminations had its maximum at at $z=500$ $\mu$m, with a standard deviation of 100 $\mu$m. The
branching angle had an average of $20^\circ$, with a standard deviation of
$5^\circ$. At branching points, the plane containing the branches had a uniform random
orientation, resulting in a 3-dimensional structure of the axon bundle.

Numerical simulations of action potentials propagating along these axons
yielded the membrane currents from which we calculated the extracellular
fields. This procedure is described in detail by @Gold2006Origin.
Briefly, the extracellular medium is assumed to be a homogeneous volume
conductor with conductivity $\sigma_e$, and a quasi-static approximation of the
electrical field potential $\phi$ is made. The extracellular potential
$\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$ at location $\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$ due to a current
distribution $I(\mathbf{r},t)$ is then governed by the equation $\Delta
\phi(\mathbf{r},t) = \frac{1}{\sigma_e} I(\mathbf{r},t)$, with $\Delta$
denoting the Laplace operator [@Nunez2006Electric]. If the currents $I$ are constrained to a volume
$W$, this equation has the solution \begin{equation}
\phi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{W}\frac{I(\mathbf{r}',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}\textrm{d}\mathbf{r}'
\label{eqn:basic} \end{equation} Since the majority of the current flows
through the small nodes of Ranvier, we used the point-source approximation; we
did not use the line-source approximation [@Holt1999Electrical].

Analysis of the resulting extracellular potential included filtering. All
filtering was performed with third-order Butterworth filters. The multiunit
activity (MUA) was calculated by high-pass filtering the signal with a cutoff
of 2500\ Hz, setting all samples with negative values to zero, and then
low-pass filtering the resulting response with a cutoff of 500\ Hz. The LFP was
calculated by low-pass filtering the signal with a cutoff of 1000\ Hz.

Simplified axon-bundle model
----------------------------

\label{sec:efpresp}

To better understand the processes leading to the complex spatio-temporal
patterns of extracellular fields, we devised an analytically tractable model of
the responses. We defined the spatial dimension in cylindrical coordinates
$\mathbf{r}=(\rho,\varphi,z)$, and we considered a simple model axon bundle
that extended infinitely in the axial $z$-direction at $\rho=0$. The bundle had
a variable number of fibers along the $z$ axis, denoted by $n(z)$. We assumed
the axons to be perfect transmission lines, meaning that the action potential
is a travelling wave with velocity $v$ along the axon. In particular, we
neglected any delays and distortions that can be induced when an axon branches
or terminates. In this case, the membrane voltage was the same in each fiber
for a given $z$ coordinate. From linear cable theory [e.g. @Jack75Electric], we
then obtained the following expression for the total transmembrane current
$I(z,t)$ from a given membrane potential $V(z,t)$:

\begin{align}
I(z,t)& = \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left(n(z)\frac{\partial }{\partial z}V(z,t)\right)\\
&= \frac{\partial n}{\partial z}(z)\cdot\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}(z,t)+n(z)\cdot\frac{\partial ^2V}{\partial z^2}(z,t) 
\end{align}
<!--
\\
&= \frac{\partial n}{\partial z}(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v}\frac{\partial V}{\partial
t}(z,t)+n(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial ^2V}{\partial t^2}(z,t)

from which, together with the fact that the axial conductivity is proportional
to the number of fibers $g_{tot}=ng$ we can then derive the membrane currents
flowing at a given location:

\begin{align}
I(z,t)& = \frac{d}{dz}\left(n(z)\frac{d}{dz}V(z,t)\right)\\
&= \frac{dn}{dz}(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v}\frac{dV}{dt}(z,t)-n(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{d^2V}{dt^2}(z,t)
\end{align}
-->
Applying this membrane current to equation (\ref{eqn:basic}), we calculated the
corresponding extracellular field potential $\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$ of a given
membrane potential waveform $V(z,t)$ propagating through such an axon bundle.
Due to the rotational symmetry of the system and the fact that current flows
only at $\rho = 0$, we obtained

\begin{align}
    \phi(\mathbf{r},t) =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{I(z',t)}{\sqrt{(z-z')^2 + \rho^2}}\textrm{d}z'
\end{align}

which is independent of the angle $\varphi$.
<!--
&=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\frac{dn}{dz}(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v}\frac{dV}{dt}(z,t)-n(z)\cdot\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{d^2V}{dt^2}(z,t)}{\sqrt{(z-z')^2 + \rho^2}}\textrm{d}z'

Equation \ref{eqn:infkern} has the form of a convolution with a weighting
function $w$: \begin{equation} w(\rho,z) =
\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_e}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+\rho^2}} \label{eqn:weighting}
\end{equation}

The convolution can then be written as:

\begin{equation} \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) =
\left[I(z,t)\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z \end{equation}

with the operator $\left[\cdot\ast\cdot\right]_z$ denoting the convolution with
respect to the variable $z$.
-->

Model fitting to experimental data
----------------------------

In order to relate the model to experimentally obtained data, we performed
a nonlinear least squares fit, minimizing the mean squared error $\epsilon$
between the measured potential $\phi_\text{measured}$ and the model prediction
$\phi_\text{model}$ for ${N=32}$ measurement locations $z_n$\ ($n=1,\dots,N$)
and ${M=600}$ time points $t_m$ ($m = 1,\dots,M$): $\epsilon
= \frac{1}{NM}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{m=1}^{M}\left[\phi_\text{measured}(z_n,t_m)-\phi_\text{model}(z_n,t_m)\right]^2$.
The separation between electrodes was given by the electrode layout as 50\
$\mu$m. The time between sampling points was 5.12\ $\mu$s. We achieved the
minimization of the error $\epsilon$ using the "optimize.minimize" routine
provided by the \textsc{SciPy} package [@scipy]. The free parameters to be
determined by the optimization routine were the distance $\rho$, the conduction
velocity $v$, the number of fibers per unit length $n(z_n)$ for each
measurement location\ $z_n$, and the membrane voltage $V(z_1,t_m)$ at electrode
location $z_1$ for each time point\ $t_m$. The membrane voltage at the other
locations was then determined by the traveling-wave assumption: $V(z_n,t_m)
= V(z_1,t_m-\frac{z_n-z_1}{v})$, using a linear interpolation between
timepoints. The model assumption of a single line of axons with electrodes at
a fixed distance is a simplification of a three-dimensional axon tree where the
fibers are distributed at various distances. The distance parameter $\rho$ can
be interpreted as an average distance in this simplification.

To aid the convergence of the fit algorithm, an
initial guess for the number of fibers $n(z_z)$ was set by hand.
Initializing the guess to a constant or a fully random number of fibers resulted in
a failure to converge. However, Gaussian-like initial guesses converged
to a single solution, meaning that the specific initial guess did
not alter the final fit result. The results shown in @fig:barnowl were obtained with
an initial guess of a Gaussian with amplitude 12, centered at penetration depth
725 $\mu$m with standard deviation 400 $\mu$m.

Because of the linearity of equations 1-4 both in the current $I$ and the
membrane potential $V$, inferring the membrane voltage $V$ from the average
over trials of the EFP $\phi$ produces the average membrane voltage $V$. This
in turn is the membrane voltage response of a single spike convolved with the
peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH).
