Introduction
==============

Extracellular field potentials (EFPs) in the brain were long thought to be
primarily synaptic in origin [@Buzsaki2012Origin]. The study of the fields is
relevant for the interpretation of data collected with measurement methods
which rely on the extracellular field potential [@Brette2012Handbook].
Extracellular fields are also at the base of many noninvasive measurement
methods [@Nunez2006Electric], where the underlying mechanisms of far field
generation are often poorly understood [@Rattay2014Peak].

Many modelling studies focus on the extracellular fields induced by currents on
the dendrites and soma of the postsynaptic neuron [@Gold2006Origin;@Holt1999Electrical;@Einevoll2013Modelling;@Linden2011Modeling;@Linden2010Intrinsic]. However, a number of
recent data analysis and modeling studies have revealed that active,
non-synaptic membrane currents can play a role in generating EFPs
[@Reimann2013Biophysically;@Anastassiou2015Cell;@Schomburg2012Spiking]. 

The aim of this study is to understand how the EFP is influenced by the
anatomical structure of the axons. In particular, we explain how typical
projection patterns in which an axon bundle widens and then terminates in its
projection area affect the EFP. Such axon bundles, sometimes called nerves or
facicles, exist throughout the peripheral and central nervous system
[@kandel2000principles;@Hentschel1999Models;@Nornes1972Temporal;@Goodman1984Cell].
The white matter of the brain can be viewed as an agglomeration of such bundles
[@Schuz2002Human].

It has been shown [@Kuokkanen2010Origin;@Linden2011Modeling;@Denker2011Local] that with sufficient spatial and
temporal organization extracellular fields of axonal and synaptic sources can
reach strengths on the order of several mV. Here we extend this finding to
include more general axon bundles, including those receiving input with less
temporal precision.

We characterize three principal effects of axon bundle structure on the EFP.
These effects are elaborations of the properties described in past
[@Gydikov1986Influence;@Gydikov1986Extracellular;@Plonsey1977Action] for
peripheral nerves. We find that the low-frequency components of the EFP are
governed by the local density of bifurcations and terminations. The
high-frequency components are governed by the local fiber density. Furthermore
we show that the low-frequency components exceed the high-frequency components
in spatial reach.

We demonstrate these properties using two models of varying complexity, both of
them based on a forward model of the extracellular field potential
[@Holt1999Electrical;@Gold2006Origin]. The first model includes a detailed
multicompartment model of the axon population. The second is an analytically
tractable simplification of a generic bundle of axons. Finally, we demonstrate the
properties in real data using as a set of in-vivo electrophysiological
recordings from the barn owl brain stem.

Results
==============
- Axonal projections generate a dipole-like field potential (**Fig 1A**)
    - long range
    - low frequency
    - Examples of phenomenology from literature
- General results for axonal projections :
    - The low-frequency (eg population rate pulse) parts are governed by the 
      local density of bifurcations and terminations(**Fig 1B**)
    - The high-frequency (eg individual spikes, 'noise', neurophonic) parts
      are governed by the local fiber density(**Fig 1C**)
    - The low-frequency component exceeds the high-frequency component in reach (**Fig 2**)
- The barn owl neurophonic as an example that shows these properties(**Fig 3**)
    - The high-frequency component shows a steady increase in latency along the
      projections' depth, while the low-frequency can have stationary parts
      caused by sharp increases or decreases of fiber number (bifurcations or
      terminations).
    - These aspects are reflected in the model
- Ways of understanding the effect
    - Single AP along single axon(**Fig 4**)
    - Analytical model(**Fig 5**)

Discussion
==============

- Relevance of Findings
    - Interpretation of CSD
        - Classical CSD: constant fiber density, variable currents
        - Here: variable fiber density, constant currents
    - Dipole has far field, ABR response?
- Compare to other auditory systems (Chicken NL, MSO)
    - Speculate on functional relevance of polarity shift (a la Rinzel & Goldwyn)
- compare to other fiber bundle systems

Extracellular evoked potential due to a pulse of activity in a generic fiber

responses at various locations, indicated by colored dots. Scaling of traces
indicated by colorbar. Relative strength of high-frequency noise relative to
the low-frequency pulse decays with distance. The low frequency pulse switches
polarity along the nerve bundles termination zone. (**C**) shows the fiber

![Low-frequency component of the axon bundle EFP exceeds high frequency in
reach. (**A**) shows the behaviour of different spectral components (frequency
indicated by colorbar) in a double logarithmic plot. The slope indicates the
scaling coefficient in this frequency band. (**B**) shows this scaling
coefficient for different frequencies. Low frequencies have the least negative
coefficient, indicating the furthest reach.

![Data from the barn owl shows the expected behaviour predicted by the model.
(**A**-**C**) shows data from the barn owls nucleus laminaris in response to an
auditory click stimulus, compared to a simulation of the axonal structure and
activation in (**D**-**F**). The click stimulus induces a pulse of activity in the
afferent axon bundle. The low-frequency components (**B** and **E**) show the
polarity reversal. The high frequency component (**C** and **F**), does not
show such a reversal, but rather shows a steady increase in phase with
depth.](../figs/import/traces_combined_mod_log_n5000.pdf)

![The dipolar behaviour can be understood by examining individual action
potentials on a single axon tree. Comparing the low frequency owl data (**A**)
to a single axon and action potential in model (**B**) shows a similar
behaviour. In particular, the potential at a termination and that at a
bifurcation (red and green curves in **B**) are approximately
inverted.](../figs/mockups/fig4.pdf)

![Analytical model of the axon bundle potential explains the effects observed
in the numerical model and example data. (**A**) shows the behaviour of a
simplified fiber bundle with a piecewise constant fiber density (**Aa**). The
high frequency component (**Ab**) shows no polarity reversal, while the
high-frequency component (**Ac**) does, as expected from the data and
modelling. This can be understood by decomposing the signal into two
components. The first component is governed by the bifurcation and termination
density, and is filtered by the regular weighting function (**Ba**), which acts
as a low-pass filter (**Bb**). The second component is governed by the
fiber density, and is filtered by the derivative of the weighting function
(**Bc**), which acts as a high- or band-pass filter
(**Bd**).](../figs/mockups/fig5.pdf)
