Introduction
==============
Extracellular field potentials (EFPs) are at the heart of many experimental
methods used to examine the inner workings of the brain.  This includes
invasive (Local Field Potentials, Current Source Density, Multiunit Activity)
as well as noninvasive (EEG, ECoG, ABR) methods [@Brette2012Handbook;
@Nunez2006Electric]. The origins of these EFPs, especially in cases in which
the activity is not clearly attributable to a single cell, is a matter of
debate.

EFPs in the brain were long thought to be primarily synaptic in origin
[@Buzsaki2012Origin]. As a consequence, many modeling studies focus on the
extracellular fields induced by synaptic currents on the dendrites and soma of
the postsynaptic neuron [@Gold2006Origin; @Holt1999Electrical;
@Einevoll2013Modelling; @Linden2011Modeling; @Linden2010Intrinsic;
@FernandezRuiz2013Cytoarchitectonic]. However, a number of
recent data analysis and modeling efforts have revealed that active,
non-synaptic membrane currents can play an important role in generating EFPs
[@Reimann2013Biophysically; @Anastassiou2015Cell; @Schomburg2012Spiking;
@Ray2011Different; @Belluscio2012CrossFrequency], including far reaching
potentials detectable at the scalp [@Telenczuk2011Highfrequency].

One of the reasons for the traditional assumption that axonal currents
contribute little to the EFP is that the far field of an action potential
traveling along an idealized straight axon is quadrupolar, meaning that its far
field decays faster with distance than synaptic sources which are thought to be
dipolar [@Nunez2006Electric]. In experimental studies that recoded the EFP of
axonal responses, the EFP often has a dipolar structure. For example,
@Blot2014Ultrarapid report an EFP with the characteristic dipolar structure
recorded from the vicinity of cerebellar Purkinje cell axons.

The aim of this study is to show how these effects in the EFP of axons are influenced by
the axons' anatomical structure. In particular, we aim to explain how typical
projection patterns in which axons bifurcate and then terminate in their
projection area affect the EFP. Such axon bundles, sometimes called nerves or
facicles, exist throughout the peripheral and central nervous system of most
animals [@kandel2000principles; @Hentschel1999Models; @Nornes1972Temporal;
@Goodman1984Cell]. The white matter of the mammalian brain can be viewed as an
agglomeration of such bundles [@Schuz2002Human].

Results
==============
We characterize three principal effects of axon bundle structure on the EFP.
Firstly, the low-frequency components of the EFP are governed by the densities
of bifurcations and terminations and can have a dipolar structure. Secondly, the
high-frequency components are governed by the local fiber density. Furthermore
we show that the low-frequency components exceed the high-frequency components
in spatial reach. In particular, the dipolar low-frequency components exceed
the reach of the presumed quadrupolar nature of axonal EFPs.

These properties are first investigated by numerical model based on a forward
simulation of the extracellular field potential [@Holt1999Electrical;
@Gold2006Origin]. This first model includes a large-scale multicompartment model
of the axon population. We then show a concrete example of the effects in
experimental data using as a set of multi-site in-vivo electrophysiological
recordings from the barn owl brain stem. Finally, we show the mechanisms
underlying the observed effects by means of a second, analytically tractable,
model of a generic axon bundle. 

*Axonal projections generate a dipole-like field potential.* To understand the
effect of axon geometry on the EFP, we simulated a fiber bundle that at first
runs at constant diameter and without bifurcations, then reaches a bifurcation
zone with an increasing number of fibers, before finally terminating (Figure 1A
and 1D). The bundle fibers were stimulated with a background spontaneous rate,
upon which a pulse of increased activity was added. The resulting extracellular
potential was calculated for several locations along the axon trunk. The
spatial behaviour of the low-frequency component of the EFP differed strongly
from that of the high-frequency component, so we analyzed them separately.
Low-frequency responses are shown in the top half of Figure 1, and
low-frequency responses are shown in the lower half.

The distribution of maximum amplitudes, shown by the contour lines in Figure
1A, showed the double-lobed shape typical of a dipole, and exceeds the reach of
the high-frequency maximum responses (Fig. 1D). The low-frequency waveforms
(Fig 1B) show a biphasic deflection that is elicited by the population firing
rate pulse. This deflection was visible at all recoring locations. It reversed
polarity in the middle of the bifurcation zone of the bundle.

The same distribution of maximum amplitudes for the high-frequency component,
shown in Figure 1D, did not show the same lobed shape. Instead it decayed much
faster with distance in both axial and radial direction. This was also
reflected in the waveforms (Fig 1E). There is an increase in amplitude due to
the firing rate pulse at locations close to the nerve bundle, but at locations
further away from the trunk it is no longer distinguishable from the background
activity.

![Axonal projections generate a dipole-like extracellular field potential (EFP)
when stimulated with  a pulse of activity. **A** shows the modeled axon bundle
in black, along with iso-amplitude lines for the low-pass filtered EFP
signature of the activity pulse. The contours show the typical double-lobe of a
dipole. The waveforms, recorded at the locations of the colored dots in **A**
and shown in **B**, also show a polarity reversal. The most salient locations
are highlighted with the gray box. The transition ocurrs by inverting the
envelope with aproximately constant phase, not by a shifting of phase with
constant envelope. **C** shows the progression of the maximum amplitude with
depth (red line). It closely follows the local density of bifurcations and
terminations (black histogram). The situation is different for the
high-frequency component. The iso-amlitude contours shown in **D** do not
exhibit the same double-lobe structure, and the waveforms (**C**) also don't
reverse polarity. The amplitude envelope of the high-frequency component (red
line in **E**) follows the density of fibers (black histogram in **E**.

*Frequency components are related to different anatomical features.*
To better understand the relationship between axonal anatomy and this spatial
structure of the EFP, we plotted the change in density of the bundle, meaning
the number of terminations subtracted from the number of bifurcations at a
given 

The low-frequency component shows a distinct relationship to the anatomy: it
appears to be governed by the local density of bifurcations and terminations.
Along the nerve trunk the fiber density is constant, and the low frequency
component is unchanged. As the axon bundle reaches its projection zone, the
number of bifurcations increases, and the low frequency component increases in
amplitude. In the middle of the projection zone, the number of bifurcations and
terminations cancels out.  Correspondingly, the low-frequency component
amplitude reaches a local minimum.  As the end of the projection zone
approaches, the terminations outweigh the bifurcations, and the amplitude
increases, but the polarity is reversed (Rows 7&8 in Figure 1B). As the axon
bundle ends, there are no longer any bifurcations or terminations, and the
amplitude decays.

The high-frequency component changes its amplitude in the longitudinal direction in
accordance to the local fiber density. It has an approximately
constant amplitude along the nerve trunk and then increases in amplitude as the
fiber density is increased by bifurcations. As the fibers terminate and fiber
density decreases, so does the amplitude of the high-frequency component.

These relationships suggest that the particular structure of the axon bundle
gives rise to the dipolar field potential. Because dipolar fields are
associated with a longer spatial reach that the quarupolar fields typically
associated with axonal spikes, we decided to investigate the effect that axon
structure has on the spatial reach of the frequency components. To do this we
performed a further simulation of an axon bundle, this time omitting the
bifurcations, and letting the fibers terminate directly. The resulting distance
decay profiles are shown in Figure 2. In axial direction, the low-frequency
component has a further reach than the high frequency component in the
bifurcating case (Figure 1A), but not in the non-bifurcating case (Figure 1C).
In the radial direction, the situation is different: the bifurcating (Figure
1B) and non-bifurcating (Figure 1D) case both show a faster decay of the
high-frequency component than of the low-frequency component. To assure that
the effect was due to the bifurcations themselves and not due to the fanned out
structure of the bifurcating bundle seen in Figures 1A and 1D, we here changed
the layout of both bundles to have constant widths.

![Low-frequency component of the axon bundle EFP exceeds high-frequency
component in reach, modulated by axon structure. All plots show the scaling of
the low-frequency (blue lines) and high-frequency (green lines) frequency
components on a doubly-logarithmic scale. Amplitudes were normalized to unit
value at the end of the tuft in axial direction (**A** and **C**) and from the
trunk in radial direction (**B** and **D**). **A** and **B** show the behaviour
in the case of a bifurcating bundle, while **C** and **D** show the
nonbifurcating case. In the bifurcating case, the low-frequency component
exceeds the reach of the high-frequency comonent in both directions. In the
non-bifurcating case, the decay is the same for both components in the axial
direction. This is consistent with the presence of a low-frequency dipole-like
potential in the bifurcating bundle but not in the non-bifurcating
bundle.](../figs/fig_2.pdf)

*The barn owl neurophonic as an example that shows these properties.* In order
to test our model of the extracellular field of axon bundles, we compared it to
recordings from the barn owl auditory brain stem. We adjusted the model
parameters to match the anatomy and physiology of nucleus laminaris (NL), and
set the activation statistics to match measured PSTHs in response to
stimulation by a click sound presented to one ear. We then simulated the
resulting EFP at varying depths, corresponding to recording depths in the
experiment. The resulting recordings from experiment and simulation are shown
in Figure 3.

The simulated EFPs showed several characteristics that are also observed in the
data.  Firstly, the high-frequency component shows a steady increase in latency
along the projections' depth, and has its maximum in amplitude in the middle of
NL.  The low-frequency component reverses polarity along the depth of NL, and
almost vanishes in the middle of NL. This is the same behaviour as shown for
the generic axon bundle in the previous section.

It is interesting to note that a similar reversal of polarity in NL has been
reported for chicken [@Schwarz1992Can], as well as in the mamalian analog to
NL, the medial superior olive [@Laughlin2010Oscillatory]. The phase reversal in
this case has been modeled based on the assumption that the postsynaptic NL and
MSO dendrites with their bipolar morphology have a dipolar EFP response
[@Laughlin2010Oscillatory; @Goldwyn2014Model]. However, in the owl this dipolar
morphology is largely absent [@carr90], making dendritic sources unlikely.


![Data from the barn owl shows the expected behaviour predicted by the model.

auditory click stimulus, compared to a simulation of the axonal structure and
activation in (**C**,**D**). The click stimulus induces a pulse of activity in the
afferent axon bundle. The low-frequency components (**A** and **C**) show the
polarity reversal. The high frequency component (**B** and **D**), does not
show such a reversal, but rather shows a steady increase in phase with
depth.](../figs/fig_3.pdf)

*Mechanism underlying the observed properties I.* We begin by looking at the
response of a single axon tree to a single spike at various locations along the
tree, as shown in Figure 4. This can already give us a rough idea about
the origin of the observed polarity reversal.

The extracellular response at a recording location along a continuation of the
axon, i.e.\ not close to a bifurcation or termination, is triphasic (blue trace in
Figure 4B). It has been noted that this shape is
approximated by the second derivative of the membrane voltage: the first
positive peak is the initial bend to the rising flank of the action potential,
the main dip corresponds to the high curvature at the peak of the action
potential, and the final, positive peak corresponds to the bend from
hyperpolarization to recovery.

The potential near a bifurcation (red trace in Figure 4B)
has a more biphasic shape. There is a small initial peak, but the response is
dominated by the second, negative and the third, positive peak. This can be
understood by comparing the shape to the previous example along a
non-bifurcating axon: The initial shape resembles the non-bifurcating case,
because the action potential is still mainly within the segments before the
bifurcation. As the action potential passes the bifurcation, there are now two
instances of the action potential, and the second and third peak are doubled in
size, leading to the more biphasic response.

The same reasoning can be applied to the case of the biphasic response at a
termination (green trace in Figure 4B): here there is an
approaching action potential, leading to an initial positive peak, but as the
termination is reached, the current flow ceases, and there is only a reduced
second peak, and the third peak, associated with the action potential moving
away from the recording location, disappears completely.

A notable point here is that the potential at the bifurcation and termination
are similar in shape, but opposite in polarity. This resembles the observed
polarity reversal. It is thus not hard to imagine that this effect is caused by
the response being dominated by bifurcations in the early part of NL where the
axons branch out, and then by terminations in the later part, where
terminations are more prevalent, with the two canceling out in the middle. We
will test this intuition in the following by examining the properties of a full
bundle of axons in a simplified analytical model.

![The dipolar behaviour can be understood by examining individual action
potentials on a single axon tree. Comparing the low frequency owl data (**A**)
to a single axon and action potential in model (**B**) shows a similar
behaviour. In particular, the potential at a termination and that at a
bifurcation (red and green curves in **B**) are approximately
inverted.](../figs/mockups/fig4.pdf)

*Mechanism underlying the observed properties II.* In the case of a simplified
one-dimensional axon bundle, the EFP at a given location may be described by
the formula $\Phi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[\left\{n(z)\cdot
i_\lambda(z,t)\right\}\ast w(a,z)\right]_z$ (see Methods and appendix).
Assuming that the weighting function $w$ tends to 0 for large $\left|z\right|$,
and with the introduction of the single axon current integral
$I_\lambda(z,t)=\int_{-\infty}^zi_\infty(z',t)dz'$, the equation can be split
(for a derivation, see appendix) into two components:

\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:splitpot} 
  \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) = &\left[\left\{n(z)\cdot I_\lambda(z,t)\right\}\ast w'(\rho,z)\right]_z \\
  & - \left[\left\{n'(z)\cdot I_\lambda(z,t)\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z 
\end{align}

In the first component the single axon current integral $I_\lambda(z,t)$ is
multiplied by the local density of the fibers $n$, while the weighting function
is replaced by its spatial derivative $w'$. In the second component,
$I_\lambda$ is multiplied by the derivative of the density $n'$, but here the
weighting function $w$ is unchanged. The functions $w$ and $w'$ are shown in
the time and frequency domain in Figure 4.

Further inspection of the two components shows an intriguing similarity to the
properties of the response observed in the previous sections. The first
component is high-pass filtered, and is related to the fiber density, just like
'noise' component in Figure 1 and the high-frequency component in the barn owl
data and model. The second component is low-pass filtered, and related to the
derivative of the fiber density, just like the firing rate pulse related
deflection in Figure 1, and the low-frequency component in the barn owl.

<!--The origin of the distinct components will become even clearer when considering
a minimal example of a fiber density distribution in the shape of a piecewise
constant function:

\begin{equation}
  n(z) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll}
       n_0 & \textrm{for } z < z_0\\
       n_1 & \textrm{for } z_0 < z < z_1 \\
       0   & \textrm{for } z_1 < z
     \end{array}
   \right.  
  \label{eqn:piecewise-density}
\end{equation}

In this case, the field potential can be approximated as:

- this may be wrong, double check

\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:minimalpot} 
  \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) \approx \, & - n(z)\left[w'(\rho,z)\ast I_\lambda(z,t)\right]_z \\ 
  & + (n_1-n_0)I_\lambda(z_0,t)w(\rho,z-z_0) \\  
  & - n_1 I_\lambda(z_1,t)w(\rho,z-z_1)
\end{align}

The first component can be viewed as a filtered version of $I_\lambda$ for an
infinite axon bundle. Due to the constant propagation velocity, the filtering
in space can be seen as an equivalent filter in time. In this case
the filter is $w'$, which is an antisymmetric function, and as such a high-pass
or band-pass filter, and the frequency response tends to zero for low
frequencies (Figure 5B).  Thus, this component contributes a local (meaning
depending on recording location) version of the signal, with the low
frequencies removed.

The timecourse of the second and third component does not depend on $I_\lambda$
at the recording location $z$, but rather at the locations of the bifurcations
and terminations, $z_0$ and $z_1$, and the amplitudes are attenuated according
to $w$ by the distance between these points and the recording location.

If the changes in the membrane currents are slow compared to $(z_1-z_0)/v$, we
can conclude that $I_\lambda(z_0,t) \approx I_\lambda(z_1,t)$, and the second
and third component will cancel each other out at a point $z_c$ that fulfills
$(n_1-n_0)w(\rho,z_c-z_0) = n_1 w(\rho,z_c-z_1)$.

![Analytical model of the axon bundle potential explains the effects observed

high-frequency component (**Ab**) shows no polarity reversal, while the
low-frequency component (**Ac**) does, as expected from the data and
modeling. This can be understood by decomposing the signal into two
components. The first component is governed by the bifurcation and termination
density, and is filtered by the regular weighting function (**Ba**), which acts
as a low-pass filter (**Bb**). The second component is governed by the
fiber density, and is filtered by the derivative of the weighting function

Experimental recordings
-----------------------


Numerical model
---------------------

We modeled the axons using NEURON [@Hines1997NEURON; @Hines2009NEURON] in a model based on previous work by
(**refs**), including the high and low threshold potassium channels used by (**refs**).
The axon was modeled as a sequence of active nodes and passive myelinated
segments. The parameters for the active and passive segments are described in
Table \ref{tab:modparam}. Unlike previous models, we included branching axons
in our simulations. These were generated by connecting two passive segments to
a node, and continuing the alternation of active and passive segment in each
resulting branch.

Action potentials were initiated in the axons by injecting a current pulse into
the first node of Ranvier of the axon. The times of the injections were chosen by
drawing from an inhomogeneous Poisson distribution based on the firing
statistics of NM units in response to a given stimulus.

- Split barn owl and general axon bundle

Axon branching patterns were generated procedurally, **better wording** starting with the root
segment, placed at the border of NL. In order to avoid artifacts from the
current pulse injection and to simulate the fiber tract leading up to NL, a
sequence of 10 active and passive segments without bifurcations was added
before the root. To this root, segments were appended iteratively. Before
adding a segment, a decision whether to branch or terminate an axon was drawn
from a probability distribution dependent on the dorsoventral depth of the end
of the previous segment. These probability distributions were modeled as
logistic functions with the parameters adjusted to roughly match the numbers of
branchings and terminations found in the tracings shown in publications such as
@carr90. This meant that an initial phase of bifurcations was followed
by a phase of terminations, with the probability of termination reaching 100\%
at the end of NL.

The simulations of these axons yielded the membrane currents, from which we
calculated the extracellular fields. The procedure for this is described in
detail by @Gold2006Origin, among others. Briefly, the extracellular medium is
assumed to be a homogeneous volume conductor with conductivity $\sigma_e$, and a quasi-static approximation
of the electrical field potential $\phi$ is made. The extracellular potential
due to a current distribution $i(\mathbf{r},t)$ is then governed by the
equation $\Delta \phi = \frac{1}{\sigma_e} i(\mathbf{r},t)$, with $\Delta$
denoting the Laplace operator. If the currents $i$ are constrained to a volume
$V$, this equation has the solution:
\begin{equation}
  \phi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{V}\frac{i(\mathbf{r}',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}\textrm{d}\mathbf{r}'
  \label{eqn:basic}
\end{equation}
Since the currents though the myelinated segments were negligible, and the
nodes of Ranvier are small, we used the point source approximation of only the
node currents, and did not include the line source approximation used by @Holt1999Electrical.

Simplified axon bundle model
----------------------------

\label{sec:efpresp}

We define the spatial dimension in cylindrical coordinates $\mathbf{r}=(\rho,\varphi,z)$ such that $z$ is the
dorsoventral direction, increasing from dorsal to ventral, and $z=0$ is the dorsal
border of NL. We further define $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{z}$ as the unit vector in $z$ direction, and
$\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\rho}$ as an arbitrary unit vector perpendicular to the $z$
direction.

Let us first consider a simple model axon that extends
infinitely on both sides and in a straight line from the dorsal direction into
NL, and at 0 in the remaining coordinates. Furthermore, we consider a single
action potential propagating along this axon. This axon then has a non-zero
current density only at $\rho=0$, which we denote $i_{\infty}(z,t)$, meaning
that in this case $i(\mathbf{r},t)=\delta(\rho)i_{\infty}(z,t)$. Applying this to equation \ref{eqn:basic},
corresponding response $\kappa_{\infty}(\mathbf{r},t)$ of an action potential propagating
through such a line-axon is then 

\begin{align}
\kappa_{\infty}(\mathbf{r},t) & =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{V}\frac{\delta(\rho')i_{\infty}(z',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}\textrm{d}\mathbf{r}'\label{eq:halfline}\\
& =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{i_{\infty}(z',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-z'\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{z}|}\textrm{d}z'
\end{align}
We will call this response a spike kernel because it will take the
role of an integral kernel in the following.

Due to the rotational symmetry, the kernel at a distance $\rho$ from the axon,
regardless of $\varphi$, can then be described by
\begin{align} \label{eqn:infkern}
\kappa_{\infty}(\mathbf{r},t) & =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{i_{\infty}(z',t)}{|(z-z')\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{z} + \rho\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\rho}|}\textrm{d}z' \\
& =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{i_{\infty}(z',t)}{\sqrt{(z-z')^2 + \rho^2}}\textrm{d}z' 
\end{align}

Equation \ref{eqn:infkern} has the form of a convolution with a weighting
function $w$:
\begin{equation}
  w(\rho,z) = \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_e}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+\rho^2}}
  \label{eqn:weighting}
\end{equation}

The convolution can then be written as:

\begin{equation}
\kappa_{\infty}(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[i_{\infty}(z,t)\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z
\end{equation}

with the operator $\left[\cdot\ast\cdot\right]_z$ denoting the convolution with
respect to the variable $z$.

The simplest model of a terminating axon will be a semi-infinite
axon, where the membrane current flow is simply set to zero beyond the
termination point $z_\text{term}$. Using the Heaviside step function $H$ we
find kernel $\kappa_{\text{term}}$ of a spike in a terminating axon:

\begin{equation}
  \kappa_{\text{term}}(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[\left\{H(z_\text{term}-z)\cdot i_{\infty}(z,t)\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z
\end{equation}
Similarly, the model of a bifurcating axon would be one in which the current
flow after the bifurcation point $z_\text{bif}$ is double that of the single
infinite fiber.
\begin{equation}
  \kappa_{\text{bif}}(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[\left\{\left(1+H(z-z_\text{bif})\right)\cdot i_{\infty}(z,t)\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z
\end{equation}
This places the child branches in superposition at $\rho=0$, which is a useful
approximation for small branching angles.

Approximating terminations and bifurcations in this way disregards the boundary
effects that may appear due to the conservation of charge and the inability of
 charge to flow beyond the termination. However, since the integral over
$i_\infty$ is zero for realistic action potentials, the conservation of charge
is maintained in the long run.

In more general terms, a coherently stimulated axon bundle with terminations
and bifurcations along it's path can be described by the number of individual
fibers $n(z)$ at any depth. The extracellular potential $\kappa_\text{b}$ of
such a bundle in which the action potential is initiated at the same time and
location is then given by
\begin{equation}
  \kappa_{\text{b}}(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[\left\{n(z)\cdot i_{\infty}(z,t)\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z
  \label{eqn:bundlekern}
\end{equation}

If we want to calculate the combined field of many axons and action
potentials, we can do so by linearly summing the individual axon fields.

If all axons in the bundle are driven with the same the mean firing rate
$\lambda(t)$, which might be modulated in time, the field potential
$\Phi(\mathbf{r},t)$ in response to this firing rate will be the (temporal)
convolution of the firing rate with the response of the bundle to a coherent
spike in all axons:

\begin{equation}
  \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[\kappa_\text{b}(\mathbf{r},t) \ast \lambda(t)\right]_t
  \label{eqn:fullpot}
\end{equation}
Substituting equation \ref{eqn:bundlekern} into equation \ref{eqn:fullpot}, and taking advantage of the fact that only $i_\infty$ and $\lambda$ depend on $t$ gives

\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:switchedpot}
  \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) & =  \left[\left[\left\{n(z)\cdot i_{\infty}(z,t)\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z \ast \lambda(t)\right]_t \\
  & =  \left[\left\{n(z)\cdot \left[i_{\infty}(z,t)\ast \lambda(t)\right]_t\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z
\end{align}
With the average current in a single infinite fiber stimulated with $\lambda$, which we will denote it with $i_\lambda(z,t) := \left[i_{\infty}(z,t)\ast \lambda(t)\right]_t$ this gives us

\begin{align}
  \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) & =  \left[\left\{n(z)\cdot i_\lambda(z,t)\right\}\ast w(a,z)\right]_z
  \label{eqn:switchedpotend}
\end{align}
