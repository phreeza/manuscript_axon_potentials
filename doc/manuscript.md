title: Extracellular potentials generated by axonal projections are shaped by patterns of bifurcations and terminations

date: \today

Introduction
==============
Extracellular field potentials (EFPs) are at the heart of many experimental
methods used to examine the inner workings of the brain.  This includes
invasive methods such as Local Field Potentials (LFP), Current Source Density
(CSD) and Multiunit Activity (MUA) as well as noninvasive methods such as
Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocorticogram (ECoG) and the auditory
brainstem response (ABR) [@Brette2012Handbook; @Nunez2006Electric]. The origins
of these EFPs, especially in cases in which the activity is not clearly
attributable to a single cell, is a matter of debate.

EFPs in the brain were long thought to be primarily synaptic in origin
[@Buzsaki2012Origin]. As a consequence, many modeling studies focussed on the
extracellular fields induced by synaptic currents on the dendrites and the soma of
a postsynaptic neuron [@Gold2006Origin; @Holt1999Electrical;
@Einevoll2013Modelling; @Linden2011Modeling; @Linden2010Intrinsic;
@FernandezRuiz2013Cytoarchitectonic]. However, a number of
recent data analysis and modeling efforts have revealed that active,
non-synaptic membrane currents can play an important role in generating EFPs
[@Reimann2013Biophysically; @Anastassiou2015Cell; @Schomburg2012Spiking;
@Ray2011Different; @Belluscio2012CrossFrequency], including far reaching
potentials detectable at the scalp
[@Telenczuk2011Highfrequency; @Telenczuk2015Correlates]. However, currents from
the axon are still thought to be so small as to be of minor importance for the EFP.

One of the reasons for the traditional assumption that axonal currents
contribute little to the EFP is that the far field of an action potential
traveling along an idealized straight axon is quadrupolar, meaning that its far
field decays faster with distance than synaptic sources, which are thought to be
dipolar [@Nunez2006Electric]. However, in experimental studies that recorded the EFP of
axonal responses, the EFP often has a dipolar structure. For example,
@Blot2014Ultrarapid report an EFP with the characteristic dipolar structure
recorded from the vicinity of cerebellar Purkinje cell axons.

In the results section we will present a further new example of such a field potential
from the auditory brainstem of the barn owl.

This discrepancy between theory and experiment raises the open question of how
axons are able to generate dipolar field potentials.

The aim of this study is to show how dipolar far fields in the EFP of axons can
be explained by the axons' anatomical structure. In particular, we show that
the branchings and terminations of axons in their projection area lead to
a dipolar EFP structure. Such axon bundles, often also called nerves or
fascicles, exist throughout the peripheral and central nervous system of most
animals [@kandel2000principles; @Hentschel1999Models; @Nornes1972Temporal;
@Goodman1984Cell]. The white matter of the mammalian brain can be viewed as an
agglomeration of such bundles [@Schuz2002Human]. We therefore predict
pronounced contributions of nerves or fascicles to EFPs, which are neglected in
all current models.

Properties of the EFP due to axonal projections are first investigated by
a numerical model based on forward simulation [@Holt1999Electrical;
@Gold2006Origin]. This first model includes a large-scale multicompartment
model of the axon population. We then show a concrete example of the effects in
experimental data using as a set of multi-site in-vivo electrophysiological
recordings from the barn owl brain stem. Finally, we outline the mechanisms
underlying the observed effects by means of a second, analytically tractable,
model of a generic axon bundle. 

Results
==============
<!-- TODO: To discussion?
We characterize three principal effects of axon bundle structure on the EFP.
Firstly, the low-frequency components of the EFP are governed by the densities
of bifurcations and terminations and can have a dipolar structure. Secondly, the
high-frequency components are governed by the local fiber density. Furthermore
we show that the low-frequency components exceed the high-frequency components
in spatial reach. In particular, the dipolar low-frequency components exceed
the reach of the presumed quadrupolar nature of axonal EFPs.-->

*Effects of axonal morphologies on extracellular action potentials*
In order to understand the way that common anatomical structures affect the
extracellular waveform associated with a single action potential, we simulated
simple axons that showed isolated instances of these features in order to
inspect their contributions to the EFP. We began by simulating an infinitely long axon
following a straight line path, neither bifurcating nor terminating ([@fig:simpletree]A).

Next we simulated the response of an axon that terminates ([@fig:simpletree]B).
Here the approaching action potential (top traces) can be seen to have the
same, triphasic shape as in the non-branching case. When it approaches the
termination, it gradually deforms into a biphasic response, with the positive
peak preceding the negative peak.

The other structure commonly found in axons is a bifurcation. We simulated
a single axon which bifurcates three times on each branch within a distance of
50 $\mu$m, leading to a total number of 8 fibers leaving the bifurcation zone
([@fig:simpletree]C). The potential near this bifurcating axon also has a more
biphasic shape. There is a small initial peak, but the response is dominated by
the second, negative and the third, positive peak. This can be understood by
comparing the shape to the previous example along a non-bifurcating axon: The
initial peak resembles the non-bifurcating case, because the action potential
is still mainly within the segments before the bifurcation. As the action
potential passes the bifurcation, there are now several instances of the action
potential, and the second and third peak are multiplied in size, leading to the
more biphasic response. In the case of a single bifurcation, this effect is
also present, but the amplification of the second and third peak relative to
the first peak is not as notable as in this example.

To understand how bifurcations and terminations interact when they are present
in the same axon (as they must always be in a real axon), we simulated an axon
with an identical number of bifurcations as in the previous case, but then
added terminations to all the fibers 200 $\mu$m after the bifurcation zone
([@fig:simpletree]D). We found that this leads to the same biphasic responses
observed as observed in the cases of the isolated anatomical features, with the
triphasic response occurring briefly in-between the two features.

A notable point here is that the potential at the bifurcation and termination
are similar in shape, but opposite in polarity. 

- why this is interesting.
- why we now move to a bundle

*Axonal projections generate a dipole-like field potential.* To understand how
axons can generate a dipolar EFP, we simulated a parallel fiber bundle that at
first runs at constant diameter without bifurcations and then reaches
a projection zone. Within this projection zone, the fibers first bifurcate,
which increases the number of fibers. Finally, the axons reach a termination
zone, in which the number of fibers decreases to zero ([@fig:bigtree]A).

The spiking activity of a generic axon bundle was simulated by stimulating the
fibers with a background spontaneous firing rate of 100 spikes/second, upon
which a pulse of increased activity was added. This pulse of activity could
relate to any kind of evoked activity in the nervous system, such as a sensory
stimulation, motor activity or a spontaneous transient increase in population
spiking activity. We chose a gaussian pulse with an amplitude of 2900
spikes/second and a standard deviation of 2.8 ms.

To characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the evoked EFP, the potential
was calculated for several locations along the axon trunk. Because we first
want to study the effect of the rate pulse on the EFP, we low-pass filtered the
EFP responses with a cut-off frequency of 1 kHz ([@fig:bigtree]B). The distribution
of maximum amplitudes of these responses are shown by the  colored contour
lines in [@fig:bigtree]A and the colored traces in [@fig:bigtree]B. Surrounding the
projection zone of the axon bundle, amplitudes show the double-lobed shape
typical of a dipole.

In [@fig:bigtree]B, all the responses showed a biphasic deflection that was elicited
by the population firing rate pulse. This deflection was visible at all
recording locations. The biphasic deflection reverses polarity in the middle of
the bifurcation zone of the bundle (red box in [@fig:bigtree]B). The polarity
reversal occurs by a decrease of the amplitude to zero and subsequent
reappearance with reversed polarity, as opposed to a polarity reversal through
a gradual shift in phase. This behaviour is also typical for a dipolar field
potential.

The point of the polarity reversal coincides roughly with the middle of the
projection zone. This means that the absolute value of the response amplitude
reaches a local minimum just when the number of axonal fibers reaches
a maximum. To better understand how anatomical features and response amplitude
are related, we compared the signed maximum value (meaning the *signed* value
corresponding to the maximum *absolute* amplitude) of the EFP  with the
difference in the density of branchings and terminations ([@fig:bigtree]C).

Along the nerve trunk the fiber density is constant. As the axon bundle reaches
its projection zone, the number of bifurcations increases. In the middle of the
projection zone, the number of bifurcations and terminations cancels out. At
the same depth, the amplitude crosses zero.  As the end of the projection zone
approaches, the terminations outweigh the bifurcations. As the axon bundle
ends, there are no longer any bifurcations or terminations, and the density
decays toward zero.

Interestingly, the amplitude of the maximum response (red trace) follows the
distribution of branchings and terminations (black histogram).

<!--To better understand the relationship between axonal anatomy and this spatial
structure of the EFP, we plotted the change in density of the bundle, meaning
the number of terminations subtracted from the number of bifurcations at a
given 

The low-frequency component shows a distinct relationship to the anatomy: it
appears to be governed by the local density of bifurcations and terminations.
Along the nerve trunk the fiber density is constant, and the low frequency
component is unchanged. As the axon bundle reaches its projection zone, the
number of bifurcations increases, and the low frequency component increases in
amplitude. In the middle of the projection zone, the number of bifurcations and
terminations cancels out.  Correspondingly, the low-frequency component
amplitude reaches a local minimum.  As the end of the projection zone
approaches, the terminations outweigh the bifurcations, and the amplitude
increases, but the polarity is reversed (red box in [@fig:bigtree]B). As the
axon bundle ends, there are no longer any bifurcations or terminations, and the
amplitude decays.

The same distribution of maximum amplitudes for the high-frequency component,
shown in [@fig:bigtree]D, did not show the same lobed shape. Instead it decayed
much faster with distance in both axial and radial direction. This was also
reflected in the waveforms (Fig 1E). There is an increase in amplitude due to
the firing rate pulse at locations close to the nerve bundle, but at locations
further away from the trunk it is no longer distinguishable from the background
activity.-->

To understand the contributions related to individual spikes, we next turned
our attention to the high-frequency range. We filtered the EFP responses with
a high-pass filter, using the same cut-off frequency of 1kHz as before. The
maximum amplitudes for this frequency band did not show a double-lobe, but
rather appeared like an ellipsoid centered at the projection zone
([@fig:bigtree]D). The waveforms are more disparate across recording locations,
suggesting a more local nature. There is no visible polarity reversal
([@fig:bigtree]E). 

The high-frequency component changes its amplitude in the longitudinal
direction in accordance to the local fiber density ([@fig:bigtree]F). It has an
approximately constant amplitude along the nerve trunk and then increases in
amplitude as the fiber density is increased by bifurcations. As the fibers
terminate and fiber density decreases, so does the amplitude of the
high-frequency component.

We have thus shown a qualitatively different behaviour in the low- and
high-frequency components of the EFP. Both appear to be related to anatomy,
though each in a different way.  Together, these relationships suggest that the
particular branching and terminating structure of the axon bundle gives rise to
the dipolar field potential. Because dipolar fields are associated with
a longer spatial reach than the quadrupolar fields typically associated with
axonal spikes, we decided to investigate the effect that axon structure has on
the spatial reach of the frequency components ([@fig:distscaling]). To do this
we performed a further simulation of an axon bundle, this time omitting the
bifurcations, and letting the fibers terminate directly. In axial direction,
the low-frequency component has a further reach than the high frequency
component in the bifurcating case ([@fig:distscaling]A), but not in the
non-bifurcating case ([@fig:distscaling]C).  In the radial direction, the
situation is different: the bifurcating ([@fig:distscaling]B) and
non-bifurcating ([@fig:distscaling]D) case both show a faster decay of the
high-frequency component than of the low-frequency component. To assure that
the effect was due to the bifurcations themselves and not due to the fanned out
structure of the bifurcating bundle seen in [@fig:distscaling]A and
[@fig:distscaling]D, we here changed the layout of both bundles to have
constant widths.

![Low-frequency component of the axon bundle EFP exceeds high-frequency
component in reach, modulated by axon structure. All plots show the scaling of
the low-frequency (blue lines) and high-frequency (green lines) frequency
components on a doubly-logarithmic scale. Amplitudes were normalized to unit
value at the end of the tuft in axial direction (**A** and **B**) and from the
trunk in radial direction (**C** and **D**). **A** and **C** show the behaviour
in the case of a bifurcating bundle, while **B** and **D** show the
nonbifurcating case. In the bifurcating case, the low-frequency component
exceeds the reach of the high-frequency comonent in both directions. In the
non-bifurcating case, the decay is the same for both components in the axial
direction. The scaling behaviours are consistent with the presence of
a low-frequency dipole-like potential in the bifurcating bundle but not in the
non-bifurcating bundle.](../figs/fig_3.pdf){#fig:distscaling}

*The barn owl neurophonic as an example that shows these properties.* In order
to test our model of the extracellular field of axon bundles, we compared it to
recordings from the barn owl auditory brain stem.

We adjusted the model parameters to match the anatomy and physiology of nucleus
laminaris (NL), and set the activation statistics to match measured PSTHs in
response to stimulation by a click sound presented to one ear. We then
simulated the resulting EFP at varying depths, corresponding to recording
depths in the experiment. The resulting recordings from experiment and
simulation are shown in [@fig:barnowl].

The simulated EFPs showed several characteristics that are also observed in the
data.  Firstly, the high-frequency component shows a steady increase in latency
along the projections' depth, and has its maximum in amplitude in the middle of
NL.  The low-frequency component reverses polarity along the depth of NL, and
almost vanishes in the middle of NL. This is the same behaviour as shown for
the generic axon bundle in the previous section.

It is interesting to note that a similar reversal of polarity in NL has been
reported for chicken [@Schwarz1992Can], as well as in the mammalian analog to
NL, the medial superior olive [@Laughlin2010Oscillatory]. The phase reversal in
this case has been modeled based on the assumption that the postsynaptic NL and
MSO dendrites with their bipolar morphology have a dipolar EFP response
[@Laughlin2010Oscillatory; @Goldwyn2014Model]. However, in the owl this dipolar
morphology is largely absent [@carr90], making dendritic sources unlikely.

![Data from the barn owl shows the expected behaviour predicted by the model.

auditory click stimulus, compared to a simulation of the axonal structure and
activation in (**C**,**D**). The click stimulus induces a pulse of activity in the
afferent axon bundle. The low-frequency components (**A** and **C**) show the
polarity reversal. The high frequency component (**B** and **D**), does not
show such a reversal, but rather shows a steady increase in phase with
depth.](../figs/fig_4.pdf){#fig:barnowl}

<!--
![The dipolar behaviour can be understood by examining individual action
potentials on a single axon tree. Comparing the low frequency owl data (**A**)
to a single axon and action potential in model (**B**) shows a similar
behaviour. In particular, the potential at a termination and that at a
bifurcation (red and green curves in **B**) are approximately
inverted.](../figs/mockups/fig4.pdf) -->

*A simplified model of axon bundle field potentials* In the case of a simplified
one-dimensional axon bundle, the EFP at a given location may be described by
the formula $\Phi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[\left\{n(z)\cdot
i_\lambda(z,t)\right\}\ast w(a,z)\right]_z$ (see Methods and appendix).
Assuming that the weighting function $w$ tends to 0 for large $\left|z\right|$,
and with the introduction of the single axon current integral
$I_\lambda(z,t)=\int_{-\infty}^zi_\infty(z',t)dz'$, the equation can be split
(for a derivation, see appendix) into two components:

\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:splitpot} 
  \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) = &\left[\left\{n(z)\cdot I_\lambda(z,t)\right\}\ast w'(\rho,z)\right]_z \\
  & - \left[\left\{n'(z)\cdot I_\lambda(z,t)\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z 
\end{align}

In the first component the single axon current integral $I_\lambda(z,t)$ is
multiplied by the local density of the fibers $n$, while the weighting function
is replaced by its spatial derivative $w'$. In the second component,
$I_\lambda$ is multiplied by the derivative of the density $n'$, but here the
weighting function $w$ is unchanged. The functions $w$ and $w'$ are shown in
the time and frequency domain in Figure 4.

Further inspection of the two components shows an intriguing similarity to the
properties of the response observed in the previous sections. The first
component is high-pass filtered, and is related to the fiber density, just like
'noise' component in [@fig:bigtree] and the high-frequency component in the barn owl
data and model. The second component is low-pass filtered, and related to the
derivative of the fiber density, just like the firing rate pulse related
deflection in [@fig:bigtree], and the low-frequency component in the barn owl.

<!--The origin of the distinct components will become even clearer when considering
a minimal example of a fiber density distribution in the shape of a piecewise
constant function:

\begin{equation}
  n(z) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll}
       n_0 & \textrm{for } z < z_0\\
       n_1 & \textrm{for } z_0 < z < z_1 \\
       0   & \textrm{for } z_1 < z
     \end{array}
   \right.  
  \label{eqn:piecewise-density}
\end{equation}

In this case, the field potential can be approximated as:

- this may be wrong, double check

\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:minimalpot} 
  \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) \approx \, & - n(z)\left[w'(\rho,z)\ast I_\lambda(z,t)\right]_z \\ 
  & + (n_1-n_0)I_\lambda(z_0,t)w(\rho,z-z_0) \\  
  & - n_1 I_\lambda(z_1,t)w(\rho,z-z_1)
\end{align}

The first component can be viewed as a filtered version of $I_\lambda$ for an
infinite axon bundle. Due to the constant propagation velocity, the filtering
in space can be seen as an equivalent filter in time. In this case
the filter is $w'$, which is an antisymmetric function, and as such a high-pass
or band-pass filter, and the frequency response tends to zero for low
frequencies (Figure 5B).  Thus, this component contributes a local (meaning
depending on recording location) version of the signal, with the low
frequencies removed.

The timecourse of the second and third component does not depend on $I_\lambda$
at the recording location $z$, but rather at the locations of the bifurcations
and terminations, $z_0$ and $z_1$, and the amplitudes are attenuated according
to $w$ by the distance between these points and the recording location.

If the changes in the membrane currents are slow compared to $(z_1-z_0)/v$, we
can conclude that $I_\lambda(z_0,t) \approx I_\lambda(z_1,t)$, and the second
and third component will cancel each other out at a point $z_c$ that fulfills
$(n_1-n_0)w(\rho,z_c-z_0) = n_1 w(\rho,z_c-z_1)$.

Numerical model
---------------------

We modeled the axons using NEURON [@Hines1997NEURON; @Hines2009NEURON] in a model based on previous work by
(**refs**), including the high and low threshold potassium channels used by (**refs**).
The axon was modeled as a sequence of active nodes and passive myelinated
segments. The parameters for the active and passive segments are described in
Table \ref{tab:modparam}. Unlike previous models, we included branching axons
in our simulations. These were generated by connecting two passive segments to
a node, and continuing the alternation of active and passive segment in each
resulting branch.

Action potentials were initiated in the axons by injecting a current pulse into
the first node of Ranvier of the axon. The times of the injections were chosen by
drawing from an inhomogeneous Poisson distribution based on the firing
statistics of NM units in response to a given stimulus.

- Split barn owl and general axon bundle

Axon branching patterns were generated procedurally, **better wording** starting with the root
segment, placed at the border of NL. In order to avoid artifacts from the
current pulse injection and to simulate the fiber tract leading up to NL, a
sequence of 10 active and passive segments without bifurcations was added
before the root. To this root, segments were appended iteratively. Before
adding a segment, a decision whether to branch or terminate an axon was drawn
from a probability distribution dependent on the dorsoventral depth of the end
of the previous segment. These probability distributions were modeled as
logistic functions with the parameters adjusted to roughly match the numbers of
branchings and terminations found in the tracings shown in publications such as
@carr90. This meant that an initial phase of bifurcations was followed
by a phase of terminations, with the probability of termination reaching 100\%
at the end of NL.

The simulations of these axons yielded the membrane currents, from which we
calculated the extracellular fields. The procedure for this is described in
detail by @Gold2006Origin, among others. Briefly, the extracellular medium is
assumed to be a homogeneous volume conductor with conductivity $\sigma_e$, and a quasi-static approximation
of the electrical field potential $\phi$ is made. The extracellular potential
due to a current distribution $i(\mathbf{r},t)$ is then governed by the
equation $\Delta \phi = \frac{1}{\sigma_e} i(\mathbf{r},t)$, with $\Delta$
denoting the Laplace operator. If the currents $i$ are constrained to a volume
$V$, this equation has the solution:
\begin{equation}
  \phi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{V}\frac{i(\mathbf{r}',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}\textrm{d}\mathbf{r}'
  \label{eqn:basic}
\end{equation}
Since the currents though the myelinated segments were negligible, and the
nodes of Ranvier are small, we used the point source approximation of only the
node currents, and did not include the line source approximation used by @Holt1999Electrical.

Simplified axon bundle model
----------------------------

\label{sec:efpresp}

We define the spatial dimension in cylindrical coordinates $\mathbf{r}=(\rho,\varphi,z)$ such that $z$ is the
dorsoventral direction, increasing from dorsal to ventral, and $z=0$ is the dorsal
border of NL. We further define $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{z}$ as the unit vector in $z$ direction, and
$\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\rho}$ as an arbitrary unit vector perpendicular to the $z$
direction.

Let us first consider a simple model axon that extends
infinitely on both sides and in a straight line from the dorsal direction into
NL, and at 0 in the remaining coordinates. Furthermore, we consider a single
action potential propagating along this axon. This axon then has a non-zero
current density only at $\rho=0$, which we denote $i_{\infty}(z,t)$, meaning
that in this case $i(\mathbf{r},t)=\delta(\rho)i_{\infty}(z,t)$. Applying this to equation \ref{eqn:basic},
corresponding response $\kappa_{\infty}(\mathbf{r},t)$ of an action potential propagating
through such a line-axon is then 

\begin{align}
\kappa_{\infty}(\mathbf{r},t) & =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{V}\frac{\delta(\rho')i_{\infty}(z',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}\textrm{d}\mathbf{r}'\label{eq:halfline}\\
& =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{i_{\infty}(z',t)}{|\mathbf{r}-z'\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{z}|}\textrm{d}z'
\end{align}
We will call this response a spike kernel because it will take the
role of an integral kernel in the following.

Due to the rotational symmetry, the kernel at a distance $\rho$ from the axon,
regardless of $\varphi$, can then be described by
\begin{align} \label{eqn:infkern}
\kappa_{\infty}(\mathbf{r},t) & =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{i_{\infty}(z',t)}{|(z-z')\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{z} + \rho\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\rho}|}\textrm{d}z' \\
& =\frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{e}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{i_{\infty}(z',t)}{\sqrt{(z-z')^2 + \rho^2}}\textrm{d}z' 
\end{align}

Equation \ref{eqn:infkern} has the form of a convolution with a weighting
function $w$:
\begin{equation}
  w(\rho,z) = \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_e}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+\rho^2}}
  \label{eqn:weighting}
\end{equation}

The convolution can then be written as:

\begin{equation}
\kappa_{\infty}(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[i_{\infty}(z,t)\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z
\end{equation}

with the operator $\left[\cdot\ast\cdot\right]_z$ denoting the convolution with
respect to the variable $z$.

The simplest model of a terminating axon will be a semi-infinite
axon, where the membrane current flow is simply set to zero beyond the
termination point $z_\text{term}$. Using the Heaviside step function $H$ we
find kernel $\kappa_{\text{term}}$ of a spike in a terminating axon:

\begin{equation}
  \kappa_{\text{term}}(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[\left\{H(z_\text{term}-z)\cdot i_{\infty}(z,t)\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z
\end{equation}
Similarly, the model of a bifurcating axon would be one in which the current
flow after the bifurcation point $z_\text{bif}$ is double that of the single
infinite fiber.
\begin{equation}
  \kappa_{\text{bif}}(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[\left\{\left(1+H(z-z_\text{bif})\right)\cdot i_{\infty}(z,t)\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z
\end{equation}
This places the child branches in superposition at $\rho=0$, which is a useful
approximation for small branching angles.

Approximating terminations and bifurcations in this way disregards the boundary
effects that may appear due to the conservation of charge and the inability of
 charge to flow beyond the termination. However, since the integral over
$i_\infty$ is zero for realistic action potentials, the conservation of charge
is maintained in the long run.

In more general terms, a coherently stimulated axon bundle with terminations
and bifurcations along it's path can be described by the number of individual
fibers $n(z)$ at any depth. The extracellular potential $\kappa_\text{b}$ of
such a bundle in which the action potential is initiated at the same time and
location is then given by
\begin{equation}
  \kappa_{\text{b}}(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[\left\{n(z)\cdot i_{\infty}(z,t)\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z
  \label{eqn:bundlekern}
\end{equation}

If we want to calculate the combined field of many axons and action
potentials, we can do so by linearly summing the individual axon fields.

If all axons in the bundle are driven with the same the mean firing rate
$\lambda(t)$, which might be modulated in time, the field potential
$\Phi(\mathbf{r},t)$ in response to this firing rate will be the (temporal)
convolution of the firing rate with the response of the bundle to a coherent
spike in all axons:

\begin{equation}
  \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[\kappa_\text{b}(\mathbf{r},t) \ast \lambda(t)\right]_t
  \label{eqn:fullpot}
\end{equation}
Substituting equation \ref{eqn:bundlekern} into equation \ref{eqn:fullpot}, and taking advantage of the fact that only $i_\infty$ and $\lambda$ depend on $t$ gives

\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:switchedpot}
  \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) & =  \left[\left[\left\{n(z)\cdot i_{\infty}(z,t)\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z \ast \lambda(t)\right]_t \\
  & =  \left[\left\{n(z)\cdot \left[i_{\infty}(z,t)\ast \lambda(t)\right]_t\right\}\ast w(\rho,z)\right]_z
\end{align}
With the average current in a single infinite fiber stimulated with $\lambda$, which we will denote it with $i_\lambda(z,t) := \left[i_{\infty}(z,t)\ast \lambda(t)\right]_t$ this gives us

\begin{align}
  \Phi(\mathbf{r},t) & =  \left[\left\{n(z)\cdot i_\lambda(z,t)\right\}\ast w(a,z)\right]_z
  \label{eqn:switchedpotend}
\end{align}
