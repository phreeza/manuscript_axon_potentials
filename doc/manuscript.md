Introduction
==============

- EFPs have recently been shown to be not only of synaptic origin

- The aim of this study is to understand how the EFP is influenced by the anatomical
structure of the axons which are the source of the potential.

<!-- This study is mainly concerned with click responses, which have two main components (Fig 1A&B)

- Low frequency click response shows polarity reversal. (Fig 1C)
    - Similar effect seen in chicken and mamals.
    - Previous models focus on dendrites, but there are no dendrites in high-f NL.


- Basic idea outline
    - interplay of bifurcations and terminations leads to dipole-like behaviour (Fig 1D)

Methods
==============
- Experimental Methods
- Multicompartment Model
- Analytical Model

Results
==============
- Axonal projections generate a dipole-like field potential
    - long range
    - low frequency
- General results for axonal projections:
    - The low-frequency (eg population rate pulse) parts are governed by the local density of bifurcations and terminations
    - The high-frequency (eg individual spikes, 'noise', neurophonic) parts are governed by the local fiber density
    - The low-frequency component exceeds the high-frequency component in reach
    - The high-frequency component shows a steady increase in latency along the
      projections' depth, while the low-frequency can have stationary parts
      caused by sharp increases or decreases of fiber number (bifurcations or
      terminations).

Discussion
==============

- Relevance of Findings
    - Interpretation of CSD
    - Dipole has far field, ABR response?
- Compare to other auditory systems (Chicken NL, MSO)
    - Speculate on functional relevance of polarity shift (a la Rinzel & Goldwyn)
- compare to other fiber bundle systems

![Minimal model of a bifurcating axon bundle. The number of fibers is a piecewise constant function of recording depth, shown on the left hand side. The center and right column show the field potential responses at various depths. The low-frequency component of the response, shown in the right column, shows a characteristic dipole-like behavior. The distance from the bundle was $\rho=200\mu$m, and the velocity $v=5$m/s.](../../axon_lfp/figures/minimal_model.pdf)
