    abstract = {"1/f-like" power spectrum scaling is a ubiquitous feature of complex systems. In such scaling, the power spectrum of a given time series is dominated by an inverse power law, resulting in an inverse linear relation between log power and log frequency. The 1/f-like power spectrum scaling properties of human, resting eyes-closed and eyes-open EEG were examined. For both eyes-closed and eyes-open EEG, log power had a significant inverse linear relation with log frequency. The slope of this relation was not correlated with previously-calculated Grassberger-Procaccia dimension estimates for the same data, indicating that the EEG is not a 1/f-like stochastic process. Further, the degree of deviation from perfect log power versus log frequency linearity was related to power in the 8-12 Hz alpha frequency band. It is speculated that this deviation may be related to the low dimension of a chaotic alpha rhythm relative to other EEG rhythms.},

    abstract = {1. A study has been made of the ionic currents in voltage-clamped single rabbit nodes of Ranvier at 22-26 degrees C both under normal conditions, and after the nerve fibres had been acutely demyelinated by a variety of treatments designed to lossen the myelin from the axonal membrane. 2. The myelin-loosening treatments included application of various combinations of: lysolecithin (to dissolve the myelin); collagenase (to loosen the connective tissue in the nodal region); high-potassium Locke solution, hypertonic and hypotonic solutions (to induce axonal volume changes). 3. At a critical stage in such treatment (usually after 15-45 min) a large outward current suddenly appeared. 4. There was no substantial change in the size of the measured inward sodium current when measured at this critical stage. 5. The outward current was blocked by internal TEA and caesium ions, had a reversal potential that became more positive when the external potassium concentration was increased, was kinetically similar to the known potassium current in frog fibres, and was therefore assumed to be a potassium current. 6. The phase of large outward current, whenever it appeared, was always accompanied by the appearance of a slow transient capacitative component in the leakage current, which indicated a marked increase in the effective nodal capacity (of 10- to 60-fold). We suggest that the slow transient capacity current reflected charging of newly exposed axonal membrane, probably in the paranodal region, which was uncovered by the various acute demyelination treatments. This internodal membrane seems to contain mostly potassium channels and few, if any, sodium channels. 7. Newly dissected fibres occasionally showed large potassium currents before treatment, particularly if they were deliberately stretched during dissection; a marked slow capacity transient current was consistently present in these fibres. 8. The effects of acute paranodal demyelination on the sodium and potassium currents, and on the transient capacity currents, can be simulated by a model in which the node is coupled to a cable-like paranode which contains Hodgkin--Huxley type potassium channels and which has a much higher leakage resistance. 9. The functional significance of the presence of potassium channels in rhe internodal region (at least in the paranode) of mammalian fibres is discussed.},

Here we report patch-clamp recordings from mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) in rat hippocampal slices. The presynaptic action potential is very short during low-frequency stimulation but is prolonged up to 3-fold during high-frequency stimulation. Voltage-gated K(+) channels in MFBs inactivate rapidly but recover from inactivation very slowly, suggesting that cumulative K(+) channel inactivation mediates activity-dependent spike broadening. Prolongation of the presynaptic voltage waveform leads to an increase in the number of Ca(2+) ions entering the terminal per action potential and to a consecutive potentiation of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents at MFB-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses. Thus, inactivation of presynaptic K(+) channels contributes to the control of efficacy of a glutamatergic synapse in the cortex.},

@article{Self2013Distinct,
    abstract = {What roles do the different cortical layers play in visual processing? We recorded simultaneously from all layers of the primary visual cortex while monkeys performed a figure-ground segregation task. This task can be divided into different subprocesses that are thought to engage feedforward, horizontal, and feedback processes at different time points. These different connection types have different patterns of laminar terminations in V1 and can therefore be distinguished with laminar recordings. We found that the visual response started 40 ms after stimulus presentation in layers 4 and 6, which are targets of feedforward connections from the lateral geniculate nucleus and distribute activity to the other layers. Boundary detection started shortly after the visual response. In this phase, boundaries of the figure induced synaptic currents and stronger neuronal responses in upper layer 4 and the superficial layers \~{}70 ms after stimulus onset, consistent with the hypothesis that they are detected by horizontal connections. In the next phase, \~{}30 ms later, synaptic inputs arrived in layers 1, 2, and 5 that receive feedback from higher visual areas, which caused the filling in of the representation of the entire figure with enhanced neuronal activity. The present results reveal unique contributions of the different cortical layers to the formation of a visual percept. This new blueprint of laminar processing may generalize to other tasks and to other areas of the cerebral cortex, where the layers are likely to have roles similar to those in area V1.

@article{Schroeder1998Spatiotemporal,
    abstract = {We investigated the spatiotemporal activation pattern, produced by one visual stimulus, across cerebral cortical regions in awake monkeys. Laminar profiles of postsynaptic potentials and action potentials were indexed with current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity profiles respectively. Locally, we found contrasting activation profiles in dorsal and ventral stream areas. The former, like V1 and V2, exhibit a 'feedforward' profile, with excitation beginning at the depth of Lamina 4, followed by activation of the extragranular laminae. The latter often displayed a multilaminar/columnar profile, with initial responses distributed across the laminae and reflecting modulation rather than excitation; CSD components were accompanied by either no changes or by suppression of action potentials. System-wide, response latencies indicated a large dorsal/ventral stream latency advantage, which generalizes across a wide range of methods. This predicts a specific temporal ordering of dorsal and ventral stream components of visual analysis, as well as specific patterns of dorsal-ventral stream interaction. Our findings support a hierarchical model of cortical organization that combines serial and parallel elements. Critical in such a model is the recognition that processing within a location typically entails multiple temporal components or 'waves' of activity, driven by input conveyed over heterogeneous pathways from the retina.},

@article{Schroeder1991Striate,
    abstract = {The striate cortical contribution to the surface pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (VEP) was investigated in awake monkeys during performance of a visual fixation task, by examining laminar profiles of VEP, current source density (CSD) and concomitant multiunit activity (MUA) in Area 17, recorded simultaneously at incremental depths using multicontact electrodes. Stimuli were black/white bar gratings centered on the fixation point. The typical surface pattern-reversal VEP over striate cortex consists of a prominent positivity peaking at 50-70 msec (P60), followed by a large negativity peaking at approx. 80 msec (N80), and then by a late broad positivity, peaking between 120 and 150 msec (P125). P60 is often preceded by a small negativity peaking at 45-55 msec (N50), and on rare occasions a small positivity (P40) is also observed. N50 is generated primarily by current sinks in Lamina 4C. P60 arises from large current sources in the supragranular laminae. N80 and P125 appear to be composite waveforms reflecting complex contributions from local activity and from activity occurring outside of the foveal/immediate parafoveal representation in Area 17. The basic physiologic sequence elicited by patterned stimulation is similar to that elicited by diffuse luminance or by electrical stimulation, but is characterized by more prominent supra- and infragranular activation. It is consistent with the cellular and synaptic anatomy of Area 17: initial activation of the thalamorecipient subdivisions of Lamina 4C, followed by activation of mid/upper Lamina 4 and of supra- and infragranular laminae. Our results suggest the possibility of differentiating synaptic stages and cellular processes reflected in the human VEP, based on homologies with simian VEP components.},

We address this question by combining in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the rat hippocampus with realistic biophysical modeling, and explore the LFP of place cell sequence spiking ( ” replays”) during sharp wave ripples. We show that multi-site perisomatic LFP amplitudes, in the ∼150–200 Hz frequency band, reliably reflect spatial constellations of spiking cells, embedded within non-spiking populations, and encode activation of local place cell ensembles during in vivo replays. We find spatiotemporal patterns in the LFP, which remain consistent between sequence replays, in conjunction with the ordered activation of place cell ensembles. Clustering such patterns provides an efficient segregation of replay events from non-replay-associated ripples. This work demonstrates how spatiotemporal ensemble spiking is encoded extracellularly, providing a window for efficient, LFP-based detection and monitoring of structured population activity in vivo.},

@article{Reichinnek2010Field,
    abstract = {Cognitive functions go along with complex patterns of distributed activity in neuronal networks, thereby forming assemblies of selected neurons. To support memory processes, such assemblies have to be stabilized and reactivated in a highly reproducible way. The rodent hippocampus provides a well studied model system for network mechanisms underlying spatial memory formation. Assemblies of place-encoding cells are repeatedly activated during sleep-associated network states called sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-Rs). Behavioral studies suggest that at any time the hippocampus harbors a limited number of different assemblies that are transiently stabilized for memory consolidation. We hypothesized that the corresponding field potentials (sharp wave-ripple complexes) contain a specific signature of the underlying neuronal activity patterns. Hence, they should fall into a limited number of different waveforms. Application of unbiased sorting algorithms to sharp wave-ripple complexes in mouse hippocampal slices did indeed reveal the reliable recurrence of defined waveforms that were robust over prolonged recording periods. Single-unit discharges tended to fire selectively with certain SPW-R classes and were coupled above chance level. Thus, field SPW-Rs of different waveforms are directly related to the underlying multicellular activity patterns that recur with high fidelity. This direct relationship between the coordinated activity of distinct groups of neurons and macroscopic electrographic signals may be important for cognition-related physiological studies in humans and behaving animals.},

@article{SchefferTeixeira2013HighFrequency,
    abstract = {Recent reports converge to the idea that high-frequency oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs) represent multiunit activity. In particular, the amplitude of LFP activity above 100 Hz—commonly referred to as  ” high-gamma” or  ” epsilon” band—was found to correlate with firing rate. However, other studies suggest the existence of true LFP oscillations at this frequency range that are different from the well established ripple oscillations. Using multisite recordings of the hippocampus of freely moving rats, we show here that high-frequency LFP oscillations can represent either the spectral leakage of spiking activity or a genuine rhythm, depending on recording location. Both spike-leaked, spurious activity and true fast oscillations couple to theta phase; however, the two phenomena can be clearly distinguished by other key features, such as preferred coupling phase and spectral signatures. Our results argue against the idea that all high-frequency LFP activity stems from spike contamination and suggest avoiding defining brain rhythms solely based on frequency range.},

@article{McColgan2017Dipolar,
    abstract = {Extracellular field potentials (EFPs) are an important source of information in neuroscience, but their physiological basis is in many cases still a matter of debate. Axonal sources are typically discounted in modeling and data analysis because their contributions are assumed to be negligible. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that contributions of axons to EFPs can be significant. Modeling action potentials propagating along axons, we showed that EFPs were prominent in the presence of a terminal zone where axons branch and terminate in close succession, as found in many brain regions. Our models predicted a dipolar far field and a polarity reversal at the center of the terminal zone. We confirmed these predictions using EFPs from the barn owl auditory brainstem where we recorded in nucleus laminaris using a multielectrode array. These results demonstrate that axonal terminal zones produce EFPs with considerable amplitude and spatial reach.},

@article{Potworowski2011Kernel,
    abstract = {Local field potentials (LFP), the low-frequency part of extracellular electrical recordings, are a measure of the neural activity reflecting dendritic processing of synaptic inputs to neuronal populations. To localize synaptic dynamics, it is convenient, whenever possible, to estimate the density of transmembrane current sources (CSD) generating the LFP. In this work, we propose a new framework, the kernel current source density method (kCSD), for nonparametric estimation of CSD from LFP recorded from arbitrarily distributed electrodes using kernel methods. We test specific implementations of this framework on model data measured with one-, two-, and three-dimensional multielectrode setups. We compare these methods with the traditional approach through numerical approximation of the Laplacian and with the recently developed inverse current source density methods (iCSD). We show that iCSD is a special case of kCSD. The proposed method opens up new experimental possibilities for CSD analysis from existing or new recordings on arbitrarily distributed electrodes (not necessarily on a grid), which can be obtained in extracellular recordings of single unit activity with multiple electrodes.},

@article{Rall1959Branching,
    abstract = {This paper is concerned with both the quantitative information and the theory required for the interpretation of certain experimental results obtained with intracellular microelectrodes. The theory treats the spread of current from a neuron soma into branching dendritic trees. Formulas are derived for the calculation of membrane resistivity from physiological measurements of whole neuron resistance and anatomical measurements of soma and dendritic dimensions. The variability of available anatomical and physiological information is discussed. The numerical result is an estimated range of membrane resistivity values for mammalian motoneurons, and a corresponding set of values for the dendritic to soma conductance ratio. These values are significantly greater than those currently accepted in the literature, mainly because the dendritic dimensions appear to have been underestimated previously. Analysis of the histological evidence also reveals significant quantitative differences between infant, adult, and chromatolytic motoneurons. The theory builds upon the classical theory of axonal membrane electrotonus; all important assumptions are explicitly stated and discussed. The theory is general and can be applied to many types of neurons with many types of dendritic trees; it is also relevant to the diffusion of material in neurons. The power of dendritic trunk diameter is shown to be a fundamental index of dendritic size. Another parameter characterizes the extensiveness of dendritic branching.},

The main results are: 1), All models yield a low-pass filtering effect, that is, a spike-width increase with increasing distance from soma. 2), A neuron's extracellular spike amplitude is seen to be approximately proportional to the sum of the dendritic cross-sectional areas of all dendritic branches connected to the soma. Thus, neurons with many, thick dendrites connected to soma will produce large amplitude spikes, and therefore have the largest radius of visibility. 3), The spike shape and amplitude are found to be dependent on the membrane capacitance and axial resistivity, but not on the membrane resistivity. 4), The spike-amplitude decay with distance r is found to depend on dendritic morphology, and is decaying as 1/r(n) with 1 <or= n <or= 2 close to soma and n >or= 2 far away.},

@article{Leski2013Frequency,
    abstract = {Despite its century-old use, the interpretation of local field potentials (LFPs), the low-frequency part of electrical signals recorded in the brain, is still debated. In cortex the LFP appears to mainly stem from transmembrane neuronal currents following synaptic input, and obvious questions regarding the 'locality' of the LFP are: What is the size of the signal-generating region, i.e., the spatial reach, around a recording contact? How far does the LFP signal extend outside a synaptically activated neuronal population? And how do the answers depend on the temporal frequency of the LFP signal? Experimental inquiries have given conflicting results, and we here pursue a modeling approach based on a well-established biophysical forward-modeling scheme incorporating detailed reconstructed neuronal morphologies in precise calculations of population LFPs including thousands of neurons. The two key factors determining the frequency dependence of LFP are the spatial decay of the single-neuron LFP contribution and the conversion of synaptic input correlations into correlations between single-neuron LFP contributions. Both factors are seen to give low-pass filtering of the LFP signal power. For uncorrelated input only the first factor is relevant, and here a modest reduction (<50\%) in the spatial reach is observed for higher frequencies (>100 Hz) compared to the near-DC () value of about . Much larger frequency-dependent effects are seen when populations of pyramidal neurons receive correlated and spatially asymmetric inputs: the low-frequency () LFP power can here be an order of magnitude or more larger than at 60 Hz. Moreover, the low-frequency LFP components have larger spatial reach and extend further outside the active population than high-frequency components. Further, the spatial LFP profiles for such populations typically span the full vertical extent of the dendrites of neurons in the population. Our numerical findings are backed up by an intuitive simplified model for the generation of population LFP. The first recording of electrical potential from brain activity was reported already in 1875, but still the interpretation of the signal is debated. To take full advantage of the new generation of microelectrodes with hundreds or even thousands of electrode contacts, an accurate quantitative link between what is measured and the underlying neural circuit activity is needed. Here we address the question of how the observed frequency dependence of recorded local field potentials (LFPs) should be interpreted. By use of a well-established biophysical modeling scheme, combined with detailed reconstructed neuronal morphologies, we find that correlations in the synaptic inputs onto a population of pyramidal cells may significantly boost the low-frequency components and affect the spatial profile of the generated LFP. We further find that these low-frequency components may be less 'local' than the high-frequency LFP components in the sense that (1) the size of signal-generation region of the LFP recorded at an electrode is larger and (2) the LFP generated by a synaptically activated population spreads further outside the population edge due to volume conduction.},

@article{Ness2016Active,
    abstract = {Key points * The local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of extracellular potentials recorded in neural tissue, is often used for probing neural circuit activity. Interpreting the LFP signal is difficult, however. * While the cortical LFP is thought mainly to reflect synaptic inputs onto pyramidal neurons, little is known about the role of the various subthreshold active conductances in shaping the LFP. * By means of biophysical modelling we obtain a comprehensive qualitative understanding of how the LFP generated by a single pyramidal neuron depends on the type and spatial distribution of active subthreshold currents. * For pyramidal neurons, the h-type channels probably play a key role and can cause a distinct resonance in the LFP power spectrum. * Our results show that the LFP signal can give information about the active properties of neurons and imply that preferred frequencies in the LFP can result from those cellular properties instead of, for example, network dynamics. Abstract The main contribution to the local field potential (LFP) is thought to stem from synaptic input to neurons and the ensuing subthreshold dendritic processing. The role of active dendritic conductances in shaping the LFP has received little attention, even though such ion channels are known to affect the subthreshold neuron dynamics. Here we used a modelling approach to investigate the effects of subthreshold dendritic conductances on the LFP. Using a biophysically detailed, experimentally constrained model of a cortical pyramidal neuron, we identified conditions under which subthreshold active conductances are a major factor in shaping the LFP. We found that, in particular, the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, Ih, can have a sizable effect and cause a resonance in the LFP power spectral density. To get a general, qualitative understanding of how any subthreshold active dendritic conductance and its cellular distribution can affect the LFP, we next performed a systematic study with a simplified model. We found that the effect on the LFP is most pronounced when (1) the synaptic drive to the cell is asymmetrically distributed (i.e. either basal or apical), (2) the active conductances are distributed non-uniformly with the highest channel densities near the synaptic input and (3) when the LFP is measured at the opposite pole of the cell relative to the synaptic input. In summary, we show that subthreshold active conductances can be strongly reflected in LFP signals, opening up the possibility that the LFP can be used to characterize the properties and cellular distributions of active conductances.},

@article{Stark2007Predicting,
    abstract = {Previous studies have shown that intracortical activity can be used to operate prosthetic devices such as an artificial limb. Previously used neuronal signals were either the activity of tens to hundreds of spiking neurons, which are difficult to record for long periods of time, or local field potentials, which are highly correlated with each other. Here, we show that by estimating multiunit activity (MUA), the superimposed activity of many neurons around a microelectrode, and using a small number of electrodes, an accurate prediction of the upcoming movement is obtained. Compared with single-unit spikes, single MUA recordings are obtained more easily and the recordings are more stable over time. Compared with local field potentials, pairs of MUA recordings are considerably less redundant. Compared with any other intracortical signal, single MUA recordings are more informative. MUA is informative even in the absence of spikes. By combining information from multielectrode recordings from the motor cortices of monkeys that performed either discrete prehension or continuous tracing movements, we demonstrate that predictions based on multichannel MUA are superior to those based on either spikes or local field potentials. These results demonstrate that considerable information is retained in the superimposed activity of multiple neurons, and therefore suggest that neurons within the same locality process similar information. They also illustrate that complex movements can be predicted using relatively simple signal processing without the detection of spikes and, thus, hold the potential to greatly expedite the development of motor-cortical prosthetic devices.},

    abstract = {How random is the discharge pattern of cortical neurons? We examined recordings from primary visual cortex (V1; Knierim and Van Essen, 1992) and extrastriate cortex (MT; Newsome et al., 1989a) of awake, behaving macaque monkey and compared them to analytical predictions. For nonbursting cells firing at sustained rates up to 300 Hz, we evaluated two indices of firing variability: the ratio of the variance to the mean for the number of action potentials evoked by a constant stimulus, and the rate-normalized coefficient of variation (Cv) of the interspike interval distribution. Firing in virtually all V1 and MT neurons was nearly consistent with a completely random process (e.g., Cv approximately 1). We tried to model this high variability by small, independent, and random EPSPs converging onto a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (Knight, 1972). Both this and related models predicted very low firing variability (Cv < 1) for realistic EPSP depolarizations and membrane time constants. We also simulated a biophysically very detailed compartmental model of an anatomically reconstructed and physiologically characterized layer V cat pyramidal cell (Douglas et al., 1991) with passive dendrites and active soma. If independent, excitatory synaptic input fired the model cell at the high rates observed in monkey, the Cv and the variability in the number of spikes were both very low, in agreement with the integrate-and-fire models but in strong disagreement with the majority of our monkey data. The simulated cell only produced highly variable firing when Hodgkin-Huxley-like currents (INa and very strong IDR) were placed on distal dendrites. Now the simulated neuron acted more as a millisecond-resolution detector of dendritic spike coincidences than as a temporal integrator. We argue that neurons that act as temporal integrators over many synaptic inputs must fire very regularly. Only in the presence of either fast and strong dendritic nonlinearities or strong synchronization among individual synaptic events will the degree of predicted variability approach that of real cortical neurons.},

    abstract = {* •  The intra-cortical local field potential (LFP) reflects a variety of electrophysiological processes and is a fundamental signal used to enhance knowledge about neuroscience. For most investigations, spike-free LFPs are mandatory for valid conclusions, but spikes can contaminate LFPs and falsify findings despite low-pass filtering or other attempts to remove spiking activity from LFPs. The extent of this fundamental problem remains unclear. Using spikes recorded in the awake monkey, we revealed how spike amplitude, spike duration, firing rate and noise statistic influence the extent to which spikes contaminate LFPs. Contamination varies with these parameters and can affect LFPs down to around 10 Hz; below this it is theoretically possible but unlikely. LFP frequencies up to the (high-) gamma band can remain unaffected, but signals above must always be carefully analysed. We propose a method to reveal modulations in spectrograms, which also allows the detection of spike contamination, and provide a systematic guide to assess spike contamination of intra-cortical LFPs. Abstract  The intra-cortical local field potential (LFP) reflects a variety of electrophysiological processes including synaptic inputs to neurons and their spiking activity. It is still a common assumption that removing high frequencies, often above 300 Hz, is sufficient to exclude spiking activity from LFP activity prior to analysis. Conclusions based on such supposedly spike-free LFPs can result in false interpretations of neurophysiological processes and erroneous correlations between LFPs and behaviour or spiking activity. Such findings might simply arise from spike contamination rather than from genuine changes in synaptic input activity. Although the subject of recent studies, the extent of LFP contamination by spikes is unclear, and the fundamental problem remains. Using spikes recorded in the motor cortex of the awake monkey, we investigated how different factors, including spike amplitude, duration and firing rate, together with the noise statistic, can determine the extent to which spikes contaminate intra-cortical LFPs. We demonstrate that such contamination is realistic for LFPs with a frequency down to ∼10 Hz. For LFP activity below ∼10 Hz, such as movement-related potential, contamination is theoretically possible but unlikely in real situations. Importantly, LFP frequencies up to the (high-) gamma band can remain unaffected. This study shows that spike–LFP crosstalk in intra-cortical recordings should be assessed for each individual dataset to ensure that conclusions based on LFP analysis are valid. To this end, we introduce a method to detect and to visualise spike contamination, and provide a systematic guide to assess spike contamination of intra-cortical LFPs.},

@article{Feldmeyer2012Excitatory,
    abstract = {Neocortical areas are believed to be organized into vertical modules, the cortical columns, and the horizontal layers 1-6. In the somatosensory barrel cortex these columns are defined by the readily discernible barrel structure in layer 4. Information processing in the neocortex occurs along vertical and horizontal axes, thereby linking individual barrel-related columns via axons running through the different cortical layers of the barrel cortex. Long-range signaling occurs within the neocortical layers but also through axons projecting through the white matter to other neocortical areas and subcortical brain regions. Because of the ease of identification of barrel-related columns, the rodent barrel cortex has become a prototypical system to study the interactions between different neuronal connections within a sensory cortical area and between this area and other cortical as well subcortical regions. Such interactions will be discussed specifically for the feed-forward and feedback loops between the somatosensory and the somatomotor cortices as well as the different thalamic nuclei. In addition, recent advances concerning the morphological characteristics of excitatory neurons and their impact on the synaptic connectivity patterns and signaling properties of neuronal microcircuits in the whisker-related somatosensory cortex will be reviewed. In this context, their relationship between the structural properties of barrel-related columns and their function as a module in vertical synaptic signaling in the whisker-related cortical areas will be discussed.},

@article{PalancaCastan2016Binaural,
    abstract = {The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is an evoked potential that reflects the responses to sound by brainstem neural centers. The binaural interaction component (BIC) is obtained by subtracting the sum of the monaural ABR responses from the binaural response. Its latency and amplitude change in response to variations in binaural cues. The BIC is thus thought to reflect the activity of binaural nuclei and is used to non-invasively test binaural processing. However, any conclusions are limited by a lack of knowledge of the relevant processes at the level of individual neurons. The aim of this study was to characterize the ABR and BIC in the barn owl, an animal where the ITD-processing neural circuits are known in great detail. We recorded ABR responses to chirps and to 1 and 4 kHz tones from anesthetized barn owls. General characteristics of the barn owl ABR were similar to those observed in other bird species. The most prominent peak of the BIC was associated with nucleus laminaris and is thus likely to reflect the known processes of ITD computation in this nucleus. However, the properties of the BIC were very similar to previously published mammalian data and did not reveal any specific diagnostic features. For example, the polarity of the BIC was negative, which indicates a smaller response to binaural stimulation than predicted by the sum of monaural responses. This is contrary to previous predictions for an excitatory-excitatory system such as nucleus laminaris. Similarly, the change in BIC latency with varying ITD was not distinguishable from mammalian data. Contrary to previous predictions, this behavior appears unrelated to the known underlying neural delay-line circuitry. In conclusion, the generation of the BIC is currently inadequately understood and common assumptions about the BIC need to be reconsidered when interpreting such measurements.},

@article{Sullivan1984Segregation,
    abstract = {The cochlear nucleus of the barn owl is composed of two anatomically distinct subnuclei, n. magnocellularis (the magnocellular nucleus) and n. angularis (the angular nucleus). In the magnocellular nucleus, neurons tend to respond at a particular phase of a stimulus sine wave. Phase locking was observed for frequencies up to 9.0 kHz. The intensity- spike count functions of magnocellular units are characterized by high rates of spontaneous activity, a narrow range of intensities over which spike counts changed from spontaneous to saturation levels, and a small increase in spike counts with intensity over that range. In the angular nucleus, neurons showed little or no tendency to respond at a certain sinusoidal phase, although some showed weak phase locking for frequencies below 3.5 kHz. Angular units typically had low spontaneous rates, large dynamic ranges, and large increases in spike counts with intensity, resulting in high saturation levels. The clear difference between the two nuclei in sensitivity to both phase and intensity and the reciprocity in response properties support the hypothesis that each nucleus is specialized to process one parameter (phase or intensity) and not the other.},

@article{Budd2010Neocortical,
    abstract = {The brain contains a complex network of axons rapidly communicating information between billions of synaptically connected neurons. The morphology of individual axons, therefore, defines the course of information flow within the brain. More than a century ago, Ram\'{o}n y Cajal proposed that conservation laws to save material (wire) length and limit conduction delay regulate the design of individual axon arbors in cerebral cortex. Yet the spatial and temporal communication costs of single neocortical axons remain undefined. Here, using reconstructions of in vivo labelled excitatory spiny cell and inhibitory basket cell intracortical axons combined with a variety of graph optimization algorithms, we empirically investigated Cajal's conservation laws in cerebral cortex for whole three-dimensional (3D) axon arbors, to our knowledge the first study of its kind. We found intracortical axons were significantly longer than optimal. The temporal cost of cortical axons was also suboptimal though far superior to wire-minimized arbors. We discovered that cortical axon branching appears to promote a low temporal dispersion of axonal latencies and a tight relationship between cortical distance and axonal latency. In addition, inhibitory basket cell axonal latencies may occur within a much narrower temporal window than excitatory spiny cell axons, which may help boost signal detection. Thus, to optimize neuronal network communication we find that a modest excess of axonal wire is traded-off to enhance arbor temporal economy and precision. Our results offer insight into the principles of brain organization and communication in and development of grey matter, where temporal precision is a crucial prerequisite for coincidence detection, synchronization and rapid network oscillations. Within the grey matter of cerebral cortex is a complex network formed by a dense tangle of individual branching axons mostly of cortical origin. Yet remarkably when presented with a barrage of complex, noisy sensory stimuli this convoluted network architecture computes accurately and rapidly. How does such a highly interconnected though jumbled forest of axonal trees process vital information so quickly? Pioneering neuroscientist Ram\'{o}n y Cajal thought the size and shape of individual neurons was governed by simple rules to save cellular material and to reduce signal conduction delay. In this study, we investigated how these rules applied to whole axonal trees in neocortex by comparing their 3D structure to equivalent artificial arbors optimized for these rules. We discovered that neocortical axonal trees achieve a balance between these two rules so that a little more cellular material than necessary was used to substantially reduce conduction delays. Importantly, we suggest the nature of arbor branching balances time and material so that neocortical axons may communicate with a high degree of temporal precision, enabling accurate and rapid computation within local cortical networks. This approach could be applied to other neural structures to better understand the functional principles of brain design.},

@article{Cuntz2010One,
    abstract = {Understanding the principles governing axonal and dendritic branching is essential for unravelling the functionality of single neurons and the way in which they connect. Nevertheless, no formalism has yet been described which can capture the general features of neuronal branching. Here we propose such a formalism, which is derived from the expression of dendritic arborizations as locally optimized graphs. Inspired by Ram\'{o}n y Cajal's laws of conservation of cytoplasm and conduction time in neural circuitry, we show that this graphical representation can be used to optimize these variables. This approach allows us to generate synthetic branching geometries which replicate morphological features of any tested neuron. The essential structure of a neuronal tree is thereby captured by the density profile of its spanning field and by a single parameter, a balancing factor weighing the costs for material and conduction time. This balancing factor determines a neuron's electrotonic compartmentalization. Additions to this rule, when required in the construction process, can be directly attributed to developmental processes or a neuron's computational role within its neural circuit. The simulations presented here are implemented in an open-source software package, the  ” TREES toolbox,” which provides a general set of tools for analyzing, manipulating, and generating dendritic structure, including a tool to create synthetic members of any particular cell group and an approach for a model-based supervised automatic morphological reconstruction from fluorescent image stacks. These approaches provide new insights into the constraints governing dendritic architectures. They also provide a novel framework for modelling and analyzing neuronal branching structures and for constructing realistic synthetic neural networks. More than a century has passed since Ram\'{o}n y Cajal presented a set of fundamental biological laws of neuronal branching. He described how the shape of the core elements of the neural circuitry – axons and dendrites – are constrained by physical parameters such as space, cytoplasmic volume, and conduction time. The existence of these laws enabled him to organize his histological observations, to formulate the neuron doctrine, and to infer directionality in signal flow in the nervous system. We show that Cajal's principles can be used computationally to generate synthetic neural circuits. These principles rigorously constrain the shape of real neuronal structures, providing direct validation of his theories. At the same time, this strategy provides us with a powerful set of tools for generating synthetic neurons, as well as a model-based approach for automated reconstructions of neuronal trees from confocal image stacks.},

    abstract = {The ongoing activity of neurons generates a spatially and time-varying field of extracellular voltage (Ve). This Ve field reflects population-level neural activity, but does it modulate neural dynamics and the function of neural circuits? We provide a cable theory framework to study how a bundle of model neurons generates Ve and how this Ve feeds back and influences membrane potential (Vm). We find that these  ” ephaptic interactions” are small but not negligible. The model neural population can generate Ve with millivolt-scale amplitude, and this Ve perturbs the Vm of  ” nearby” cables and effectively increases their electrotonic length. After using passive cable theory to systematically study ephaptic coupling, we explore a test case: the medial superior olive (MSO) in the auditory brain stem. The MSO is a possible locus of ephaptic interactions: sounds evoke large (millivolt scale) Ve in vivo in this nucleus. The Ve response is thought to be generated by MSO neurons that perform a known neuronal computation with submillisecond temporal precision (coincidence detection to encode sound source location). Using a biophysically based model of MSO neurons, we find millivolt-scale ephaptic interactions consistent with the passive cable theory results. These subtle membrane potential perturbations induce changes in spike initiation threshold, spike time synchrony, and time difference sensitivity. These results suggest that ephaptic coupling may influence MSO function.},

Here we examine, in awake rabbits, the vertical distribution of monosynaptic currents generated in a somatosensory cortical  ” barrel” column by spontaneous impulses of single, topographically aligned TC neurons. We show that closely neighboring TC neurons generate widely differing patterns of monosynaptic activation within layers 4 and 6 of their aligned column. Moreover, synaptic currents generated by TC impulses with long preceding interspike intervals are greatly enhanced in both of these layers. The degree of this enhancement differs reliably among neighboring TC neurons but, for a given neuron, is very similar in layers 4 and 6. Our results indicate that in the awake state, TC synapses throughout the depth of the cortex serve as powerful filters of sensory information that reflect individual characteristics of their parent TC neuron.},

    abstract = {Simple cells within layer IV of the cat primary visual cortex are selective for lines of a specific orientation. It has been proposed that their receptive-field properties are established by the pattern of connections that they receive from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Thalamic inputs, however, represent only a small proportion of the synapses made onto simple cells, and others have argued that corticocortical connections are likely to be important in shaping simple-cell response properties. Here we describe a mechanism that might be involved in selectively strengthening the effect of thalamic inputs. We show that neighbouring geniculate neurons with overlapping receptive fields of the same type (on-centre or off-centre) often fire spikes that are synchronized to within 1 millisecond. Moreover, these neurons often project to a common cortical target neuron where synchronous spikes are more effective in evoking a postsynaptic response. We propose that precisely correlated firing within a group of geniculate neurons could serve to reinforce the thalamic input to cortical simple cells.},

EEG potentials due to spikes are dominated by high-frequency (> 800 Hz) components. High-frequency (> 800 Hz) EEG is a genuine macroscopic marker of spiking activity. To identify the correlates of a single cortical action potential in surface EEG, we recorded simultaneously epidural EEG and single-unit activity in the primary somatosensory cortex of awake macaque monkeys. By averaging over EEG segments coincident with more than hundred thousand single spikes, we found short-lived (≈ 0.5 ms) triphasic EEG deflections dominated by high-frequency components > 800 Hz. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the grand-averaged spike correlate was 80 nV, which matched theoretical predictions, while single-neuron amplitudes ranged from 12 to 966 nV. Combining these estimates with post-stimulus-time histograms of single-unit responses to median-nerve stimulation allowed us to predict the shape of the evoked epidural EEG response and to estimate the number of contributing neurons. These findings establish spiking activity of cortical neurons as a primary building block of high-frequency epidural EEG, which thus can serve as a quantitative macroscopic marker of neuronal spikes.},

@article{Mazzoni2015Computing,
    abstract = {Leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) network models are commonly used to study how the spiking dynamics of neural networks changes with stimuli, tasks or dynamic network states. However, neurophysiological studies in vivo often rather measure the mass activity of neuronal microcircuits with the local field potential (LFP). Given that LFPs are generated by spatially separated currents across the neuronal membrane, they cannot be computed directly from quantities defined in models of point-like LIF neurons. Here, we explore the best approximation for predicting the LFP based on standard output from point-neuron LIF networks. To search for this best  ” LFP proxy”, we compared LFP predictions from candidate proxies based on LIF network output (e.g, firing rates, membrane potentials, synaptic currents) with  ” ground-truth” LFP obtained when the LIF network synaptic input currents were injected into an analogous three-dimensional (3D) network model of multi-compartmental neurons with realistic morphology, spatial distributions of somata and synapses. We found that a specific fixed linear combination of the LIF synaptic currents provided an accurate LFP proxy, accounting for most of the variance of the LFP time course observed in the 3D network for all recording locations. This proxy performed well over a broad set of conditions, including substantial variations of the neuronal morphologies. Our results provide a simple formula for estimating the time course of the LFP from LIF network simulations in cases where a single pyramidal population dominates the LFP generation, and thereby facilitate quantitative comparison between computational models and experimental LFP recordings in vivo. Leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) networks are often used to model neural network activity. The spike trains they produce, however, cannot be directly compared to the local field potentials (LFPs) that are measured by low-pass filtering the potential recorded from extracellular electrodes. This is because LFPs are generated by neurons with spatial extensions, while LIF networks typically consist of point neurons. In order to still be able to approximately predict LFPs from LIF network simulations, we here explore simple proxies for computing LFPs based on standard output from LIF network simulations. Predictions from the various LFP proxies were compared with  ” ground-truth” LFPs computed by means of well-established volume conduction theory where synaptic currents corresponding to the LIF network simulation were injected into populations of multi-compartmental neurons with realistic morphologies. We found that a simple weighted sum of the LIF synaptic currents with a single universally applicable set of weights excellently capture the time course of the LFP signal when the LFP predominantly is generated by a single population of pyramidal cells. Our study therefore provides a simple formula by which the LFP signal can be estimated directly from the LIF network activity, providing a missing quantitative link between simple neural models and LFP measures in vivo.},

    abstract = { Spatial rather than temporal factors govern the amplitude, polarity and reach of LFPs. Spatial discrimination methods separate the multiple pathways contributing to LFPs. Pathway-specific threads enable parallel readout of activity in distant populations. We list new uses, limitations and hints to study network dynamics with LFP generators. Local field potentials (LFPs) reflect the coordinated firing of functional neural assemblies during information coding and transfer across neural networks. As such, it was proposed that the extraordinary variety of cytoarchitectonic elements in the brain is responsible for the wide range of amplitudes and for the coverage of field potentials, which in most cases receive contributions from multiple pathways and populations. The influence of spatial factors overrides the bold interpretations of customary measurements, such as the amplitude and polarity, to the point that their cellular interpretation is one of the hardest tasks in Neurophysiology. Temporal patterns and frequency bands are not exclusive to pathways but rather, the spatial configuration of the voltage gradients created by each pathway is highly specific and may be used advantageously. Recent technical and analytical advances now make it possible to separate and then reconstruct activity for specific pathways. In this review, we discuss how spatial features specific to cells and populations define the amplitude and extension of LFPs, why they become virtually indecipherable when several pathways are co-activated, and then we present the recent advances regarding their disentanglement using spatial discrimination techniques. The pathway-specific threads of LFPs have a simple cellular interpretation, and the temporal fluctuations obtained can be applied to a variety of new experimental objectives and improve existing approaches. Among others, they facilitate the parallel readout of activity in several populations over multiple time scales correlating them with behavior. Also, they access information contained in irregular fluctuations, facilitating the testing of ongoing plasticity. In addition, they open the way to unravel the synaptic nature of rhythmic oscillations, as well as the dynamic relationships between multiple oscillatory activities. The challenge of understanding which waves belong to which populations, and the pathways that provoke them, may soon be overcome. },

@article{Richerson2005Classification,
    abstract = {Background: 
Classifying the types of extracellular potentials recorded when neural structures are activated is an important component in understanding nerve pathophysiology. Varying definitions and approaches to understanding the factors that influence the potentials recorded during neural activity have made this issue complex.

Methods: 
In this article, many of the factors which influence the distribution of electric potential produced by a traveling action potential are discussed from a theoretical standpoint with illustrative simulations.

Results: 
For an axon of arbitrary shape, it is shown that a quadrupolar potential is generated by action potentials traveling along a straight axon. However, a dipole moment is generated at any point where an axon bends or its diameter changes. Next, it is shown how asymmetric disturbances in the conductivity of the medium surrounding an axon produce dipolar potentials, even during propagation along a straight axon. Next, by studying the electric fields generated by a dipole source in an insulating cylinder, it is shown that in finite volume conductors, the extracellular potentials can be very different from those in infinite volume conductors. Finally, the effects of impulses propagating along axons with inhomogeneous cable properties are analyzed.

Conclusion: 
Because of the well-defined factors affecting extracellular potentials, the vague terms far-field and near-field potentials should be abandoned in favor of more accurate descriptions of the potentials.},

    abstract = {Invasive microelectrode recordings measure neuronal spikes, which are commonly considered inaccessible through standard surface electroencephalogram (EEG). Yet high-frequency EEG potentials (hf-EEG, f > 400 Hz) found in somatosensory evoked potentials of primates may reflect the mean population spike responses of coactivated cortical neurons. Since cortical responses to electrical nerve stimulation vary strongly from trial to trial, we investigated whether the hf-EEG signal can also echo single-trial variability observed at the single-unit level. We recorded extracellular single-unit activity in the primary somatosensory cortex of behaving macaque monkeys and identified variable spike burst responses following peripheral stimulation. Each of these responses was classified according to the timing of its spike constituents, conforming to one of a discrete set of spike patterns. We here show that these spike patterns are accompanied by variations in the concomitant epidural hf-EEG. These variations cannot be explained by fluctuating stimulus efficacy, suggesting that they were generated within the thalamocortical network. As high-frequency EEG signals can also be reliably recorded from the scalp of human subjects, they may provide a noninvasive window on fluctuating cortical spike activity in humans.},

@article{FernandezRuiz2013Cytoarchitectonic,
    abstract = {To determine why some pathways but not others produce sizable local field potentials (LFPs) and how far from the source can these be recorded, complementary experimental analyses and realistic modeling of specific brain structures are required. In the present study, we combined multiple in vivo linear recordings in rats and a tridimensional finite element model of the dentate gyrus, a curved structure displaying abnormally large positive LFPs. We demonstrate that the polarized dendritic arbour of granule cells (GCs), combined with the curved layered configuration of the population promote the spatial clustering of GC currents in the interposed hilus and project them through the open side at a distance from cell domains. LFPs grow up to 20 times larger than observed in synaptic sites. The dominant positive polarity of hilar LFPs was only produced by the synchronous activation of GCs in both blades by either somatic inhibition or dendritic excitation. Moreover, the corresponding anatomical pathways must project to both blades of the dentate gyrus as even a mild decrease in the spatial synchronization resulted in a dramatic reduction in LFP power in distant sites, yet not in the GC domains. It is concluded that the activation of layered structures may establish sharply delimited spatial domains where synaptic currents from one or another input appear to be segregated according to the topology of afferent pathways and the cytoarchitectonic features of the target population. These also determine preferred directions for volume conduction in the brain, of relevance for interpretation of surface EEG recordings.},

@article{Goldwyn2014Model,
    abstract = {Local field potentials are important indicators of in vivo neural activity. Sustained, phase-locked, sound-evoked extracellular fields in the mammalian auditory brainstem, known as the auditory neurophonic, reflect the activity of neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO). We develop a biophysically based model of the neurophonic that accounts for features of in vivo extracellular recordings in the cat auditory brainstem. By making plausible idealizations regarding the spatial symmetry of MSO neurons and the temporal synchrony of their afferent inputs, we reduce the challenging problem of computing extracellular potentials in a 3D volume conductor to a one-dimensional problem. We find that postsynaptic currents in bipolar MSO neuron models generate extracellular voltage responses that strikingly resemble in vivo recordings. Simulations reproduce distinctive spatiotemporal features of the in vivo neurophonic response to monaural pure tones: large oscillations (hundreds of microvolts to millivolts), broad spatial reach (millimeter scale), and a dipole-like spatial profile. We also explain how somatic inhibition and the relative timing of bilateral excitation may shape the spatial profile of the neurophonic. We observe in simulations, and find supporting evidence in in vivo data, that coincident excitatory inputs on both dendrites lead to a drastically reduced spatial reach of the neurophonic. This outcome surprises because coincident inputs are thought to evoke maximal firing rates in MSO neurons, and it reconciles previously puzzling evoked potential results in humans and animals. The success of our model, which has no axon or spike-generating sodium currents, suggests that MSO spikes do not contribute appreciably to the neurophonic.},

    abstract = {Neurogenesis was studied in rat spinal cord by correlation of the observations from [(3)H]thymidine autoradiography and Golgi techniques. The temporal pattern of the origin of neurons systematically lagged along the ventro-dorsal and rostro-caudal axes. The temporal pattern was correlated with the topographic pattern of the release and segregation of the newly formed neuroblasts from the neuroepithelium. These temporal and topographic patterns of neuroblast genesis imparted an order to the settling of the neuroblasts. Further, the emerging cytoarchitecture of the differentiating neuroblasts resulted in the formation of oriented interfaces along which the axons grew. The "pioneering" fibers grew along the interfaces formed by the regressed neuroepithelium and the assembled neuroblasts. As development progressed, the axons formed later "selectively fasciculated" along the "pioneering" fibers in a staggered pattern as a result of their differential times of origin. These temporal and topographic patterns occurred in a manner such that the preexisting structure served as an "organizing structure" or foundation upon which the axonal processes formed later in the developmental sequence were oriented and assembled.},

Such an approach can take advantage of the accessible cells of the grasshopper embryo and the accessible genes of Drosophila. The growth cones of identified neurons express selective affinities for specific axonal surfaces; such specificities give rise to the stereotyped patterns of selective fasciculation common to both species. These and other results suggest that early in development cell lineage and cell interactions lead to the differential expression of cell recognition molecules on the surfaces of small subsets of embryonic neurons whose axons selectively fasciculate with one another. Monoclonal antibodies reveal surface molecules in the Drosophila embryo whose expression correlates with this prediction. It should now be possible to isolate the genes encoding these potential cell recognition molecules and to test their function through the use of molecular genetic approaches in Drosophila.},

It is well established that field effects occur during pathological conditions, such as epilepsy, but less clear if they play a functional role in the healthy brain. Here, we describe the principles of field effect interactions, discuss identified field effects in diverse brain structures from the teleost Mauthner cell to the mammalian cortex, and speculate on the function of these interactions. Recent evidence supports that relatively weak endogenous and exogenous field effects in laminar structures reach significance because they are amplified by network interactions. Such interactions may be important in rhythmogenesis for the cortical slow wave and hippocampal sharp wave-ripple, and also during transcranial stimulation.},

@article{Denker2011Local,
    abstract = {While oscillations of the local field potential (LFP) are commonly attributed to the synchronization of neuronal firing rate on the same time scale, their relationship to coincident spiking in the millisecond range is unknown. Here, we present experimental evidence to reconcile the notions of synchrony at the level of spiking and at the mesoscopic scale. We demonstrate that only in time intervals of significant spike synchrony that cannot be explained on the basis of firing rates, coincident spikes are better phase locked to the LFP than predicted by the locking of the individual spikes. This effect is enhanced in periods of large LFP amplitudes. A quantitative model explains the LFP dynamics by the orchestrated spiking activity in neuronal groups that contribute the observed surplus synchrony. From the correlation analysis, we infer that neurons participate in different constellations but contribute only a fraction of their spikes to temporally precise spike configurations. This finding provides direct evidence for the hypothesized relation that precise spike synchrony constitutes a major temporally and spatially organized component of the LFP.},

@article{Schomburg2012Spiking,
    abstract = {When monitoring neural activity using intracranial electrical recordings, researchers typically consider the signals to have two primary components: fast action potentials (APs) from neurons near the electrode, and the slower local field potential (LFP), thought to be dominated by postsynaptic currents integrated over a larger volume of tissue. In general, a decrease in signal power with increasing frequency is observed for most brain rhythms. The 100–200 Hz oscillations in the rat hippocampus, including  ” fast gamma” or  ” epsilon” oscillations and sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs), are one exception, showing an increase in power with frequency within this band. We have used detailed biophysical modeling to investigate the composition of extracellular potentials during fast oscillations in rat CA1. We find that postsynaptic currents exhibit a decreasing ability to generate large-amplitude oscillatory signals at high frequencies, whereas phase-modulated spiking shows the opposite trend. Our estimates indicate that APs and postsynaptic currents contribute similar proportions of the power contained in 140–200 Hz ripples, and the two combined generate a signal that closely resembles in vivo SPW-Rs. Much of the AP-generated signal originates from neurons further than 100 μm from the recording site, consistent with ripples appearing similarly strong regardless of whether or not they contain recognizable APs. Additionally, substantial power can be generated in the 90–150 Hz epsilon band by the APs of rhythmically firing pyramidal neurons. Thus, high-frequency LFPs may generally contain signatures of local cell assembly activation.},

We examined phase–phase coupling of theta and gamma oscillators in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus during maze exploration and rapid eye movement sleep. Hippocampal theta waves were asymmetric, and estimation of the spatial position of the animal was improved by identifying the waveform-based phase of spiking, compared to traditional methods used for phase estimation. Using the waveform-based theta phase, three distinct gamma bands were identified: slow gammaS (gammaS; 30–50 Hz), midfrequency gammaM (gammaM; 50–90 Hz), and fast gammaF (gammaF; 90–150 Hz or epsilon band). The amplitude of each sub-band was modulated by the theta phase. In addition, we found reliable phase–phase coupling between theta and both gammaS and gammaM but not gammaF oscillators. We suggest that cross-frequency phase coupling can support multiple time-scale control of neuronal spikes within and across structures.},

@article{Ray2011Different,
    abstract = {During cognitive tasks electrical activity in the brain shows changes in power in specific frequency ranges, such as the alpha (8–12 Hz) or gamma (30–80 Hz) bands, as well as in a broad range above ∼80 Hz, called the high-gamma band. The role or significance of this broadband high-gamma activity is unclear. One hypothesis states that high-gamma oscillations serve just like gamma oscillations, operating at a higher frequency and consequently at a faster timescale. Another hypothesis states that high-gamma power is related to spiking activity. Because gamma power and spiking activity tend to co-vary during most stimulus manipulations (such as contrast modulations) or cognitive tasks (such as attentional modulation), it is difficult to dissociate these two hypotheses. We studied the relationship between high-gamma power, gamma rhythm, and spiking activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake monkeys while varying the stimulus size, which increased the gamma power but decreased the firing rate, permitting a dissociation. We found that gamma power became anti-correlated with the high-gamma power, suggesting that the two phenomena are distinct and have different origins. On the other hand, high-gamma power remained tightly correlated with spiking activity under a wide range of stimulus manipulations. We studied this relationship using a signal processing technique called Matching Pursuit and found that action potentials are associated with sharp transients in the LFP with broadband power, which is visible at frequencies as low as ∼50 Hz. These results distinguish broadband high-gamma activity from gamma rhythms as an easily obtained and reliable electrophysiological index of neuronal firing near the microelectrode. Further, they highlight the importance of making a careful dissociation between gamma rhythms and spike-related transients that could be incorrectly decomposed as rhythms using traditional signal processing methods. Electrical activity in the brain often shows oscillations at distinct frequencies, such as the alpha (8–12 Hz) or gamma (30–80 Hz) bands, which have been linked with distinct cognitive states. In addition, changes in power are seen in a broad range above ∼80 Hz, called the  ” high-gamma” band. High-gamma power could arise either from sustained oscillations (similar to gamma rhythms but operating at higher frequencies) or from brief bursts of power associated with spikes generated near the electrode ( ” spike bleed-through”). It is difficult to dissociate these two hypotheses because gamma oscillations and spiking are correlated during most stimulus or cognitive manipulations. Further, most signal processing techniques decompose any signal into a set of oscillatory functions, making it difficult to represent any transient power fluctuations that occur at the time of spikes. We address the first issue by using a stimulus manipulation for which gamma oscillations and spiking activity are anti-correlated, permitting dissociation. To address the second issue, we use a signal processing technique called Matching Pursuit, which is well suited to capture transient activity. We show that gamma and high-gamma power become anti-correlated, suggesting different biophysical origins. Spikes and high-gamma power, however, remain tightly correlated. Broadband high-gamma activity could therefore be an easily obtained and reliable electrophysiological index of neuronal firing in the vicinity of an electrode.},

@article{Barry2015Axonal,
    abstract = {While extracellular somatic action potentials from freely moving rats have been well characterized, axonal activity has not. We have recently reported extracellular tetrode recordings of short duration waveforms (SDWs) with an average peak-trough duration less than 172 μs. These waveforms have significantly shorter duration than somatic action potentials and tend to be triphasic. The present review discusses further data that suggests SDWs are representative of axonal activity, how this characterization allows for more accurate classification of somatic activity and could serve as a means of exploring signal integration in neural circuits. The review also discusses how axons may function as more than neural cables and the implications this may have for axonal information processing. While the technical challenges necessary for the exploration of axonal processes in functional neural circuits during behavior are impressive, preliminary evidence suggests that the in vivo study of axons is attainable. The resulting theoretical implications for systems level function make refinement of this approach a necessary goal toward developing a more complete understanding of the processes underlying learning, memory and attention as well as the pathological states underlying mental illness and epilepsy.},

@article{Reimann2013Biophysically,
    abstract = {Brain activity generates extracellular voltage fluctuations recorded as local field potentials (LFPs). It is known that the relevant microvariables, the ionic currents across membranes, jointly generate the macrovariables, the extracellular voltage, but neither the detailed biophysical knowledge nor the required computational power have been available to model these processes. We simulated the LFP in a model of the rodent neocortical column composed of >12,000 reconstructed, multicompartmental, and spiking cortical layer 4 and 5 pyramidal neurons and basket cells, including five million dendritic and somatic compartments with voltage- and ion-dependent currents, realistic connectivity, and probabilistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. We found that, depending on a number of factors, the LFP reflects local and cross-layer processing. Active currents dominate the generation of LFPs, not synaptic ones. Spike-related currents impact the LFP not only at higher frequencies but below 50 Hz. This work calls for re-evaluating the genesis of LFPs.

@article{Linden2010Intrinsic,
    abstract = {The local field potential (LFP) is among the most important experimental measures when probing neural population activity, but a proper understanding of the link between the underlying neural activity and the LFP signal is still missing. Here we investigate this link by mathematical modeling of contributions to the LFP from a single layer-5 pyramidal neuron and a single layer-4 stellate neuron receiving synaptic input. An intrinsic dendritic low-pass filtering effect of the LFP signal, previously demonstrated for extracellular signatures of action potentials, is seen to strongly affect the LFP power spectra, even for frequencies as low as 10 Hz for the example pyramidal neuron. Further, the LFP signal is found to depend sensitively on both the recording position and the position of the synaptic input: the LFP power spectra recorded close to the active synapse are typically found to be less low-pass filtered than spectra recorded further away. Some recording positions display striking band-pass characteristics of the LFP. The frequency dependence of the properties of the current dipole moment set up by the synaptic input current is found to qualitatively account for several salient features of the observed LFP. Two approximate schemes for calculating the LFP, the dipole approximation and the two-monopole approximation, are tested and found to be potentially useful for translating results from large-scale neural network models into predictions for results from electroencephalographic (EEG) or electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings.},

This is due to both the advent of multielectrodes, which has enabled recording of LFPs at tens to hundreds of sites simultaneously, and the insight that LFPs offer a unique window into key integrative synaptic processes in cortical populations. However, owing to its numerous potential neural sources, the LFP is more difficult to interpret than are spikes. Careful mathematical modelling and analysis are needed to take full advantage of the opportunities that this signal offers in understanding signal processing in cortical circuits and, ultimately, the neural basis of perception and cognition.},

@article{Linden2011Modeling,
    abstract = {The local field potential (LFP) reflects activity of many neurons in the vicinity of the recording electrode and is therefore useful for studying local network dynamics. Much of the nature of the LFP is, however, still unknown. There are, for instance, contradicting reports on the spatial extent of the region generating the LFP. Here, we use a detailed biophysical modeling approach to investigate the size of the contributing region by simulating the LFP from a large number of neurons around the electrode. We find that the size of the generating region depends on the neuron morphology, the synapse distribution, and the correlation in synaptic activity. For uncorrelated activity, the LFP represents cells in a small region (within a radius of a few hundred micrometers). If the LFP contributions from different cells are correlated, the size of the generating region is determined by the spatial extent of the correlated activity.

@article{Tenke1993Interpretation,
    abstract = {Current source density (CSD) analysis provides an index of the location, direction, and density of transmembrane currents that arise with synchronous activation of neural tissue and that generate an evoked potential profile in the extracellular medium. In neocortex and other laminated structures, a simplified, one-dimensional CSD analysis can be computed by differentiation of voltages sampled at discrete points in a linear array. One-dimensional CSD analysis is a practical and accurate method for defining both regional activity patterns and neural generators of surface-recorded evoked and event-related potentials. In computing the CSD, common practices of differentiating across spatial grids of 200 μm or more and use of spatial smoothing routines help to reduce noise, but severely limit the spatial resolution available to the analysis. High-resolution CSD procedures (i.e., 3 point differentiation using a spatial grid of 100 μm or less) are more suited to identification of processes within individual cortical laminae or sublaminae, but can magnify the contributions of computational artifacts. Despite the inclusion of independent indices of cellular activity (e.g., multiunit activity), both high- and lowresolution analyses may indicate current source and sink configurations for which there is more than one plausible physiological interpretation. In the present study we examined the resolving capacity and pitfalls of common CSD procedures using simulated ensembles of current dipoles. These were positioned and oriented to model the depolarization of lamina 4C stellate cells and thalamocortical afferents in macaque striate cortex. Empirically, the surface N40 appears in association with a CSD configuration which includes current sinks within the thalamorecipient (stellate) subdivisions of lamina 4C and a large current source extending considerably below 4C. Dipole ensemble contributions to the CSD profile were computed and compared to physiological data from this region. Small asymmetries in activation of model stellate laminae were sufficient to produce substantial open field contributions. However, the best fit with empirical CSD profile was found when the simulation included contributions from thalamocortical axons, along with both open and closed field contributions from dual stellate cell sublaminae. High-resolution CSD profiles were shown to be interpretable when computational artifacts characteristic of closed and open fields were identified using a series of differentiation grids.},

It is shown that it is necessary to give up the usual assumption of homogeneity and isotropy in the extracellular medium.

Slow "on" and "off" potentials reversed polarity with recording depth, indicating that synaptically activated dendrites of fusiform cells were dorsal for ipsilateral and ventral for contralateral stimuli. Oscillations at sound frequency were found to be maintained for the duration of the stimulus (neurophonic potential, or NP). In contrast to slow "on" and "off" potentials, NPs were gradually shifted in phase as the electrodes penetrated the NL from dorsal to ventral. Neurophonic oscillation frequencies obtained with clicks and noise were equal to best pure tone frequencies yielding maximal NP amplitudes. Autocorrelation functions calculated from steady state NPs in response to pure tone stimuli indicated a presence of sine waves in noise, and power spectra typically consisted of single frequency components. NPs, slow "on" and slow "off" potentials were sharply tuned over similar frequency ranges and tuning tended to be sharper for higher frequencies. The NP represents an electrical replica of the sound waveform which may be present across the fusiform cell membrane.},

    abstract = {Early neural responses to acoustic signals can be electrically recorded as a series of waves, termed the auditory brainstem response (ABR). The latencies of the ABR waves are important for clinical and neurophysiological evaluations. Using a biophysical model of transmembrane currents along spiral ganglion cells, we show that in human (i) the non-myelinated somatic regions of type I cells, which innervate inner hair cells, predominantly contribute to peak I, (ii) the supra-strong postsynaptic stimulating current (400 pA) and transmembrane currents of the myelinated peripheral axons of type I cells are an order smaller; such postsynaptic currents correspond to the short latencies of a small recordable ABR peak I', (iii) the ABR signal involvement of the central axon of bipolar type I cells is more effective than their peripheral counterpart as the doubled diameter causes larger transmembrane currents and a larger spike dipole-length, (iv) non-myelinated fibers of type II cells which innervate the outer hair cells generate essentially larger transmembrane currents but their ABR contribution is small because of the small ratio type II/type I cells, low firing rates and a short dipole length of spikes propagating slowly in non-myelinated fibers. Using a finite element model of a simplified head, peaks In and II (where In is the negative peak after peak I) are found to be stationary potentials when volleys of spikes cross the external electrical conductivity barrier at the bone\&dura/CSF and at the CSF/brainstem interface whereas peaks I' and I may be generated by strong local transmembrane currents as postsynaptic events at the distal ending and the soma region of type I cells, respectively. All simulated human inter-peak times (I-I', II-I, In-I) are close to published data. Copyright {\copyright} 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Although the major contributor of the extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other sources--including Na(+) and Ca(2+) spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations--can substantially shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

    abstract = {The electrochemical processes that underlie neural function manifest themselves in ceaseless spatiotemporal field fluctuations. However, extracellular fields feed back onto the electric potential across the neuronal membrane via ephaptic coupling, independent of synapses. The extent to which such ephaptic coupling alters the functioning of neurons under physiological conditions remains unclear. To address this question, we stimulated and recorded from rat cortical pyramidal neurons in slices with a 12-electrode setup. We found that extracellular fields induced ephaptically mediated changes in the somatic membrane potential that were less than 0.5 mV under subthreshold conditions. Despite their small size, these fields could strongly entrain action potentials, particularly for slow (<8 Hz) fluctuations of the extracellular field. Finally, we simultaneously measured from up to four patched neurons located proximally to each other. Our findings indicate that endogenous brain activity can causally affect neural function through field effects under physiological conditions.},

@article{Kuokkanen2013Linear,
    abstract = {The neurophonic potential is a synchronized frequency-following extracellular field potential that can be recorded in the nucleus laminaris (NL) in the brainstem of the barn owl. Putative generators of the neurophonic are the afferent axons from the nucleus magnocellularis, synapses onto NL neurons, and spikes of NL neurons. The output of NL, i.e., action potentials of NL neurons, are only weakly represented in the neurophonic. Instead, the inputs to NL, i.e., afferent axons and their synaptic potentials, are the predominant origin of the neurophonic (Kuokkanen et al., 2010). Thus, in NL the monaural inputs from the two brain sides converge and create a binaural neurophonic. If these monaural inputs contribute independently to the extracellular field, the response to binaural stimulation can be predicted from the sum of the responses to ipsi- and contralateral stimulation. We found that a linear summation model explains the dependence of the responses on interaural time difference as measured experimentally with binaural stimulation. The fit between model predictions and data were excellent, even without taking into account the nonlinear responses of NL coincidence detector neurons, although their firing rate and synchrony strongly depend on the interaural time difference. These results are consistent with the view that afferent axons and their synaptic potentials in NL are the primary origin of the neurophonic.},

The first and second time derivatives of the intracellular action potentials were also recorded. The intracellular action potentials and their first and second time derivatives were almost the same regardless of the place of recording. With the decrease in the axial distance to the end the extracellular action potentials changed gradually in a complicated manner from a shape similar to the second time derivative into a shape similar to the first time derivative. Extracellular potentials, having two negative maxima, were recorded over the terminal taper part of the fibres.
                            These alterations were simulated by a mathematical model. It was shown that the changes in the shape of the extracellular action potentials around the end of the fibres were mainly due to the existence of the fibre end though a better correspondence of the experimentally recorded and the calculated extracellular action potentials was obtained when the morphology of the fibre end was taken into consideration.},

@article{Gydikov1986Extracellular,
    abstract = {The extracellular action potentials (ECAPs) of single active muscle fibres immersed an isotropic volume conductor were investigated. The origination of excitation in the motor end-plate and its reaching the fibre end were taken into consideration. It was explained why at short radial distances the ECAPs over the fibre at points close to the end were similar in shape to the first time derivative and at points close to the motor end-plate-to the first time derivative of the intracellular action potential (ICAP) taken with minus sign. The fibre end changed the ECAP which would be recorded if the fibre was infinite and this change called pure termination potential (PTP) was a biphase positive-negative potential, proportional to the first time derivative of the ICAP at points close to the membrane and over the very end. With increasing the radial and axial distances PTP decreases in amplitude. Taking into account the PTP, the genesis of the terminal positive phase of the ECAPs (Gydikov and Kosarov 1972a, b) can be explained. The onset of the fibre or the motor end-plate also changed the potential which would be recorded if the fibre was infinite. This change was given the term of pure onset potential (POP)-a biphase negative-positive potential, proportional to the first time derivative of the ICAP taken with minus sign at a point close to the membrane and over the motor end-plate. With increasing the radial and the axial distance POP decreased in amplitude.
                            Close to the membrane PTP and POP were commensurable with the potential of an infinite fibre only at points close to the ends or to the motor end-plate. At long radial distances they were commensurable with the potential of an infinite fibre for all axial distances.},

@article{Rothman2003Roles,
    abstract = {Using kinetic data from three different K+ currents in acutely isolated neurons, a single electrical compartment representing the soma of a ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) neuron was created. The K+ currents include a fast transient current (IA), a slow-inactivating low-threshold current (ILT), and a noninactivating high-threshold current (IHT). The model also includes a fast-inactivating Na+ current, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), and 1-50 auditory nerve synapses. With this model, the role IA, ILT, and IHT play in shaping the discharge patterns of VCN cells is explored. Simulation results indicate that IHT mainly functions to repolarize the membrane during an action potential, and IA functions to modulate the rate of repetitive firing. ILT is found to be responsible for the phasic discharge pattern observed in Type II cells (bushy cells). However, by adjusting the strength of ILT, both phasic and regular discharge patterns are observed, demonstrating that a critical level of ILT is necessary to produce the Type II response. Simulated Type II cells have a significantly faster membrane time constant in comparison to Type I cells (stellate cells) and are therefore better suited to preserve temporal information in their auditory nerve inputs by acting as precise coincidence detectors and having a short refractory period. Finally, we demonstrate that modulation of Ih, which changes the resting membrane potential, is a more effective means of modulating the activation level of ILT than simply modulating ILT itself. This result may explain why ILT and Ih are often coexpressed throughout the nervous system.},

@article{Rathouz1998Characterization,
    abstract = {Neurons of the nucleus magnocellularis (NM) preserve the timing of auditory signals through the convergence of a variety of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. To understand better how these channels interact, we have characterized the kinetics, voltage sensitivity, and pharmacology of outward currents of NM neurons in brain slices. The reversal potential (E rev) of outward currents varied with potassium concentration as expected for currents carried by potassium. However, E rev was consistently more positive than the Nernst potential for potassium (E K). Deviation of E rev from the calculated E K most likely arose from potassium accumulation in extracellular spaces by potassium conductances active at rest and during depolarizing steps. Three outward potassium currents were studied that varied in voltage and pharmacological sensitivity. A tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive, high-threshold current was activated within 1–5 ms of the onset of depolarization, with a half-maximal activation voltage (V 1/2) of −19 mV. It was blocked partially by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and was the dominant ionic conductance of NM neurons. A dendrotoxin-I (DTX) and 4-AP-sensitive, low-threshold current had a V 1/2 of −58 mV, rapid activation kinetics, and only partial inactivation, with decay time constants between 20 and 100 ms. A rapidly inactivating current was observed that was resistant to TEA and DTX and was blocked by intracellular Cs+. The transient current was inactivated almost completely at the resting potential. The onset of inactivation was fastest at potentials negative to those that caused activation. When intracellular K+ was replaced by Cs+, large inward and outward currents were obtained that corresponded respectively to the above-mentioned DTX- and TEA-sensitive currents. Outward, TEA-sensitive current was carried by Cs+, with a P Cs/P K of ∼0.1. In current-clamped neurons, DTX induced repetitive firing and increased membrane time constant near rest but had little effect on action potential duration. These studies indicate that a low-threshold, DTX-sensitive current plays a key role in making NM neurons highly responsive to the onset and offset of synaptic stimuli.},

    abstract = {Neurons initiate spikes in the axon initial segment or at the first node in the axon1, 2, 3, 4. However, it is not yet understood how the site of spike initiation affects neuronal activity and function. In nucleus laminaris of birds, neurons behave as coincidence detectors for sound source localization and encode interaural time differences (ITDs) separately at each characteristic frequency (CF)5, 6, 7. Here we show, in nucleus laminaris of the chick, that the site of spike initiation in the axon is arranged at a distance from the soma, so as to achieve the highest ITD sensitivity at each CF. Na+ channels were not found in the soma of high-CF (2.5–3.3 kHz) and middle-CF (1.0–2.5 kHz) neurons but were clustered within a short segment of the axon separated by 20–50 m from the soma; in low-CF (0.4–1.0 kHz) neurons they were clustered in a longer stretch of the axon closer to the soma. Thus, neurons initiate spikes at a more remote site as the CF of neurons increases. Consequently, the somatic amplitudes of both orthodromic and antidromic spikes were small in high-CF and middle-CF neurons and were large in low-CF neurons. Computer simulation showed that the geometry of the initiation site was optimized to reduce the threshold of spike generation and to increase the ITD sensitivity at each CF. Especially in high-CF neurons, a distant localization of the spike initiation site improved the ITD sensitivity because of electrical isolation of the initiation site from the soma and dendrites, and because of reduction of Na+-channel inactivation by attenuating the temporal summation of synaptic potentials through the low-pass filtering along the axon.},

    abstract = {How the axonal distribution of Na+ channels affects the precision of spike timing is not well understood. We addressed this question in auditory relay neurons of the avian nucleus magnocellularis. These neurons encode and convey information about the fine structure of sounds to which they are tuned by generating precisely timed action potentials in response to synaptic inputs. Patterns of synaptic inputs differ as a function of tuning. A small number of large inputs innervate high- and middle-frequency neurons, while a large number of small inputs innervate low-frequency neurons. We found that the distribution and density of Na+ channels in the axon initial segments varied with the synaptic inputs, and were distinct in the low-frequency neurons. Low-frequency neurons had a higher density of Na+ channels within a longer axonal stretch, and showed a larger spike amplitude and whole-cell Na+ current than high/middle-frequency neurons. Computer simulations revealed that for low-frequency neurons, a large number of Na+ channels were crucial for preserving spike timing because it overcame Na+ current inactivation and K+ current activation during compound EPSPs evoked by converging small inputs. In contrast, fewer channels were sufficient to generate a spike with high precision in response to an EPSP induced by a single massive input in the high/middle-frequency neurons. Thus the axonal Na+ channel distribution is effectively coupled with synaptic inputs, allowing these neurons to convey auditory information in the timing of firing.},

@article{Gold2006Origin,
    abstract = {Although extracellular unit recording is typically used for the detection of spike occurrences, it also has the theoretical ability to report about what are typically considered intracellular features of the action potential. We address this theoretical ability by developing a model system that captures features of experimentally recorded simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We use the line source approximation method of Holt and Koch to model the extracellular action potential (EAP) voltage resulting from the spiking activity of individual neurons. We compare the simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo with model predictions for the same cells reconstructed and simulated with compartmental models. The model accurately reproduces both the waveform and the amplitude of the EAPs, although it was difficult to achieve simultaneous good matches on both the intracellular and extracellular waveforms. This suggests that accounting for the EAP waveform provides a considerable constraint on the overall model. The developed model explains how and why the waveform varies with electrode position relative to the recorded cell. Interestingly, each cell's dendritic morphology had very little impact on the EAP waveform. The model also demonstrates that the varied composition of ionic currents in different cells is reflected in the features of the EAP.},

Extracellular action potentials outside axons are small in amplitude and spatially spread out, while they are larger in amplitude and much more spatially confined near cell bodies. We estimated the extracellular potentials associated with an action potential in a cortical pyramidal cell using standard one-dimensional cable theory and volume conductor theory. Their spatial and temporal pattern reveal much about the location and timing of currents in the cell, especially in combination with a known morphology, and simple experiments could resolve questions about spike initiation. From the extracellular potential we compute the ephaptically induced polarization in a nearby passive cable. The magnitude of this induced voltage can be several mV, does not spread electrotonically, and depends only weakly on the passive properties of the cable. We discuss their possible functional relevance.},

@article{Ashida2007Passive,
    abstract = {Neurons of the avian nucleus laminaris (NL) compute the interaural time difference (ITD) by detecting coincident arrivals of binaural signals with submillisecond accuracy. The cellular mechanisms for this temporal precision have long been studied theoretically and experimentally. The myelinated axon initial segment in the owl's NL neuron and small somatic spikes observed in auditory coincidence detector neurons of various animals suggest that spikes in the NL neuron are generated at the first node of Ranvier and that the soma passively receives back-propagating spikes. To investigate the significance of the  ” passive soma” structure, we constructed a two-compartment NL neuron model, consisting of a cell body and a first node, and systematically changed the excitability of each compartment. Here, we show that a neuron with a less active soma achieves higher ITD sensitivity and higher noise tolerance with lower energy costs. We also investigate the biophysical mechanism of the computational advantage of the  ” passive soma” structure by performing sub- and suprathreshold analyses. Setting a spike initiation site with high sodium conductance, not in the large soma but in the small node, serves to amplify high-frequency input signals and to reduce the impact and the energy cost of spike generation. Our results indicate that the owl's NL neuron uses a  ” passive soma” design for computational and metabolic reasons.},

@article{McLaughlin2010Oscillatory,
    abstract = {A popular model of binaural processing, proposed by Jeffress (1948), states that external interaural time delays (ITDs) are compensated by internal axonal delays allowing ITD to be spatially represented by a population of coincidence detectors in the medial superior olive (MSO). Isolating single-neuron responses in MSO is difficult because of the presence of a strong extracellular field potential known as the neurophonic, so that few studies have tested Jeffress's key prediction. Phase delays in the nucleus laminaris neurophonic in owls have been observed and are consistent with a Jeffress-like model. Here, we recorded neurophonic responses in cat MSO to monaural tones at locations along its dendritic axis. Fourier analysis of the neurophonic was used to extract amplitude and phase at the stimulus frequency. Amplitude, as a function of depth, showed two peaks separated by a dip. A half-cycle phase shift was observed at depths close to the dip, over a wide frequency range. Current source density analysis for contralateral (ipsilateral) stimulation shows a current source close to the neurophonic amplitude peak and a sink a few hundred micrometers ventromedially (dorsolaterally). These results are consistent with a dipole configuration: contralateral (ipsilateral) excitation causes a current sink at the ventromedial (dorsolateral) dendrites and a source at the soma and dorsolateral (ventromedial) dendrites. Incorporating these results in a dipole model explains the phase and amplitude patterns observed. We conclude that the half-cycle phase shift is consistent with a current dipole, making it difficult to derive measurements of axonal delays from the neurophonic.},

    abstract = {Frequency tuning and spontaneous activity in the auditory nerve and cochlear nucleus magnocellularis of the barn owl Tyto alba. J. Neurophysiol. 77: 364–377, 1997. Single-unit recordings were obtained from the brain stem of the barn owl at the level of entrance of the auditory nerve. Auditory nerve and nucleus magnocellularis units were distinguished by physiological criteria, with the use of the response latency to clicks, the spontaneous discharge rate, and the pattern of characteristic frequencies encountered along an electrode track. The response latency to click stimulation decreased in a logarithmic fashion with increasing characteristic frequency for both auditory nerve and nucleus magnocellularis units. The average difference between these populations was 0.4–0.55 ms. The most sensitive thresholds were ∼0 dB SPL and varied little between 0.5 and 9 kHz. Frequency-threshold curves showed the simple V shape that is typical for birds, with no indication of a low-frequency tail. Frequency selectivity increased in a gradual, power-law fashion with increasing characteristic frequency. There was no reflection of the unusual and greatly expanded mapping of higher frequencies on the basilar papilla of the owl. This observation is contrary to the equal-distance hypothesis that relates frequency selectivity to the spatial respresentation in the cochlea. On the basis of spontaneous rates and/or sensitivity there was no evidence for distinct subpopulations of auditory nerve fibers, such as the well-known type I afferent response classes in mammals. On the whole, barn owl auditory nerve physiology conformed entirely to the typical patterns seen in other bird species. The only exception was a remarkably small spread of thresholds at any one frequency, this being only 10–15 dB in individual owls. Average spontaneous rate was 72.2 spikes/s in the auditory nerve and 219.4 spikes/s for nucleus magnocellularis. This large difference, together with the known properties of endbulb-of-Held synapses, suggests a convergence of ∼2–4 auditory nerve fibers onto one nucleus magnocellularis neuron. Some auditory nerve fibers as well as nucleus magnocellularis units showed a quasiperiodic spontaneous discharge with preferred intervals in the time-interval histogram. This phenomenon was observed at frequencies as high as 4.7 kHz.},

The origin of the neurophonic, and thus the mechanisms that give rise to its exceptional temporal precision, has not yet been identified. Putative generators of the neurophonic are the activity of afferent axons, synaptic activation of laminaris neurons, or action potentials in laminaris neurons. To identify the generators, we analyzed the neurophonic in the high-frequency (>2.5 kHz) region of nucleus laminaris in response to monaural pure-tone stimulation. The amplitude of the neurophonic is typically in the millivolt range. The signal-to-noise ratio reaches values beyond 30 dB. To assess which generators could give rise to these large, synchronous extracellular potentials, we developed a computational model. Spike trains were produced by an inhomogeneous Poisson process and convolved with a spike waveform. The model explained the dependence of the simulated neurophonic on parameters such as the mean rate, the vector strength of phase locking, the number of statistically independent sources, and why the signal-to-noise ratio is independent of the spike waveform and subsequent filtering of the signal. We found that several hundred sources are needed to reach the observed signal-to-noise ratio. The summed coherent signal from the densely packed afferent axons and activation of their synapses on laminaris neurons are alone sufficient to explain the measured properties of the neurophonic.},

@article{Koppl1997b,
    abstract = {The auditory system of the barn owl is an important model for temporal processing on a very fast time scale and for the neural mechanisms and circuitry underlying sound localization. Phase locking has been shown to be the behaviorally relevant temporal code. This study examined the quality and intensity dependence of phase locking in single auditory nerve fibers of the barn owl to define the input to the known brainstem circuit for temporal processing. For direct comparison in the same individuals, recordings were also obtained from the relevant next higher center, the nucleus magnocellularis (NM). Phase locking was regularly seen at sound pressure levels (SPL) below those eliciting an increase in spike rate, thus providing an additional cue for signal detection. The quality of phase locking, expressed as vector strength, decreased with increasing frequency. Auditory nerve fibers showed an unusual step-like decline with a prominent plateau in the mid-frequency range (1.5–3 kHz), indicating that some specialization enables the owl to halt the deterioration and extend phase locking to frequencies up to 10 kHz, above the range commonly observed in other species. Phase locking in the NM was consistently inferior to that of auditory-nerve fibers at frequencies above 1 kHz, suggesting that the synapse plays a limiting role in temporal precision. The response delays, or group delays, derived from the phase-versus-frequency functions of auditory nerve fibers were not consistent with the unusual spatial frequency representation in the owl cochlea. This questions the common assumption that group delays reflect cochlear wave travel times.},

    abstract = {Both the mammalian and avian auditory systems localize sound sources by computing the interaural time difference (ITD) with submillisecond accuracy. The neural circuits for this computation in birds consist of axonal delay lines and coincidence detector neurons. Here, we report the first in vivo intracellular recordings from coincidence detectors in the nucleus laminaris of barn owls. Binaural tonal stimuli induced sustained depolarizations (DC) and oscillating potentials whose waveforms reflected the stimulus. The amplitude of this sound analog potential (SAP) varied with ITD, whereas DC potentials did not. The amplitude of the SAP was correlated with firing rate in a linear fashion. Spike shape, synaptic noise, the amplitude of SAP, and responsiveness to current pulses differed between cells at different frequencies, suggesting an optimization strategy for sensing sound signals in neurons tuned to different frequencies.},

@article{carr88,
    abstract = {Interaural time difference is an important cue for sound localization. In the barn owl (Tyto alba) neuronal sensitivity to this disparity originates in the brainstem nucleus laminaris. Afferents from the ipsilateral and contralateral magnocellular cochlear nuclei enter the nucleus laminaris through its dorsal and ventral surfaces, respectively, and interdigitate in the nucleus. Intracellular recordings from these afferents show orderly changes in conduction delay with depth in the nucleus. These changes are comparable to the range of interaural time differences available to the owl. Thus, these afferent axons act as delay lines and provide anatomical and physiological bases for a neuronal map of interaural time differences in the nucleus laminaris.},

@article{carr90,
    abstract = {Detection of interaural time differences underlies azimuthal sound localization in the barn owl Tyto alba. Axons of the cochlear nucleus magnocellularis, and their targets in the binaural nucleus laminaris, form the circuit responsible for encoding these interaural time differences. The nucleus laminaris receives bilateral inputs from the cochlear nucleus magnocellularis such that axons from the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus enter the nucleus laminaris dorsally, while contralateral axons enter from the ventral side. This interdigitating projection to the nucleus laminaris is tonotopic, and the afferents are both sharply tuned and matched in frequency to the neighboring afferents. Recordings of phase-locked spikes in the afferents show an orderly change in the arrival time of the spikes as a function of distance from the point of their entry into the nucleus laminaris. The same range of conduction time (160 mu sec) was found over the 700-mu m depth of the nucleus laminaris for all frequencies examined (4-7.5 kHz) and corresponds to the range of interaural time differences available to the barn owl. The estimated conduction velocity in the axons is low (3-5 m/sec) and may be regulated by short internodal distances (60 mu m) within the nucleus laminaris. Neurons of the nucleus laminaris have large somata and very short dendrites. These cells are frequency selective and phase-lock to both monaural and binaural stimuli. The arrival time of phase-locked spikes in many of these neurons differs between the ipsilateral and contralateral inputs. When this disparity is nullified by imposition of an appropriate interaural time difference, the neurons respond maximally. The number of spikes elicited in response to a favorable interaural time difference is roughly double that elicited by a monaural stimulus. Spike counts for unfavorable interaural time differences fall well below monaural response levels. These findings indicate that the magnocellular afferents work as delay lines, and the laminaris neurons work as co- incidence detectors. The orderly distribution of conduction times, the predictability of favorable interaural time differences from monaural phase responses, and the pattern of the anatomical projection from the nucleus laminaris to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus suggest that interaural time differences and their phase equivalents are mapped in each frequency band along the dorsoventral axis of the nucleus laminaris.},

@article{wagner09,
    abstract = {We used acoustic clicks to study the impulse response of the neurophonic potential in the barn owl's nucleus laminaris. Clicks evoked a complex oscillatory neural response with a component that reflected the best frequency measured with tonal stimuli. The envelope of this component was obtained from the analytic signal created using the Hilbert transform. The time courses of the envelope and carrier waveforms were characterized by fitting them with filters. The envelope was better fitted with a Gaussian than with the envelope of a gamma-tone function. The carrier was better fitted with a frequency glide than with a constant instantaneous frequency. The change of the instantaneous frequency with time was better fitted with a linear fit than with a saturating nonlinearity. Frequency glides had not been observed in the bird's auditory system before. The glides were similar to those observed in the mammalian auditory nerve. Response amplitude, group delay, frequency, and phase depended in a systematic way on click level. In most cases, response amplitude decreased linearly as stimulus level decreased, while group delay, phase, and frequency increased linearly as level decreased. Thus the impulse response of the neurophonic potential in the nucleus laminaris of barn owls reflects many characteristics also observed in responses of the basilar membrane and auditory nerve in mammals.},
