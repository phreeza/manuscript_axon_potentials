@article{Barry2015Axonal,
    abstract = {{While extracellular somatic action potentials from freely moving rats have been well characterized, axonal activity has not. We have recently reported extracellular tetrode recordings of short duration waveforms (SDWs) with an average peak-trough duration less than 172 μs. These waveforms have significantly shorter duration than somatic action potentials and tend to be triphasic. The present review discusses further data that suggests SDWs are representative of axonal activity, how this characterization allows for more accurate classification of somatic activity and could serve as a means of exploring signal integration in neural circuits. The review also discusses how axons may function as more than neural cables and the implications this may have for axonal information processing. While the technical challenges necessary for the exploration of axonal processes in functional neural circuits during behavior are impressive, preliminary evidence suggests that the in vivo study of axons is attainable. The resulting theoretical implications for systems level function make refinement of this approach a necessary goal toward developing a more complete understanding of the processes underlying learning, memory and attention as well as the pathological states underlying mental illness and epilepsy.}},

    abstract = {{Brain activity generates extracellular voltage fluctuations recorded as local field potentials (LFPs). It is known that the relevant microvariables, the ionic currents across membranes, jointly generate the macrovariables, the extracellular voltage, but neither the detailed biophysical knowledge nor the required computational power have been available to model these processes. We simulated the LFP in a model of the rodent neocortical column composed of >12,000 reconstructed, multicompartmental, and spiking cortical layer 4 and 5 pyramidal neurons and basket cells, including five million dendritic and somatic compartments with voltage- and ion-dependent currents, realistic connectivity, and probabilistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. We found that, depending on a number of factors, the LFP reflects local and cross-layer processing. Active currents dominate the generation of LFPs, not synaptic ones. Spike-related currents impact the LFP not only at higher frequencies but below 50 Hz. This work calls for re-evaluating the genesis of LFPs.

@article{Linden2010Intrinsic,
    abstract = {{The local field potential (LFP) is among the most important experimental measures when probing neural population activity, but a proper understanding of the link between the underlying neural activity and the LFP signal is still missing. Here we investigate this link by mathematical modeling of contributions to the LFP from a single layer-5 pyramidal neuron and a single layer-4 stellate neuron receiving synaptic input. An intrinsic dendritic low-pass filtering effect of the LFP signal, previously demonstrated for extracellular signatures of action potentials, is seen to strongly affect the LFP power spectra, even for frequencies as low as 10 Hz for the example pyramidal neuron. Further, the LFP signal is found to depend sensitively on both the recording position and the position of the synaptic input: the LFP power spectra recorded close to the active synapse are typically found to be less low-pass filtered than spectra recorded further away. Some recording positions display striking band-pass characteristics of the LFP. The frequency dependence of the properties of the current dipole moment set up by the synaptic input current is found to qualitatively account for several salient features of the observed LFP. Two approximate schemes for calculating the LFP, the dipole approximation and the two-monopole approximation, are tested and found to be potentially useful for translating results from large-scale neural network models into predictions for results from electroencephalographic (EEG) or electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings.}},

                The past decade has witnessed a renewed interest in cortical local field potentials (LFPs) - that is, extracellularly recorded potentials with frequencies of up to ∼500 Hz. This is due to both the advent of multielectrodes, which has enabled recording of LFPs at tens to hundreds of sites simultaneously, and the insight that LFPs offer a unique window into key integrative synaptic processes in cortical populations. However, owing to its numerous potential neural sources, the LFP is more difficult to interpret than are spikes. Careful mathematical modelling and analysis are needed to take full advantage of the opportunities that this signal offers in understanding signal processing in cortical circuits and, ultimately, the neural basis of perception and cognition.

    abstract = {{
                The local field potential (LFP) reflects activity of many neurons in the vicinity of the recording electrode and is therefore useful for studying local network dynamics. Much of the nature of the LFP is, however, still unknown. There are, for instance, contradicting reports on the spatial extent of the region generating the LFP. Here, we use a detailed biophysical modeling approach to investigate the size of the contributing region by simulating the LFP from a large number of neurons around the electrode. We find that the size of the generating region depends on the neuron morphology, the synapse distribution, and the correlation in synaptic activity. For uncorrelated activity, the LFP represents cells in a small region (within a radius of a few hundred micrometers). If the LFP contributions from different cells are correlated, the size of the generating region is determined by the spatial extent of the correlated activity.

@article{Tenke1993Interpretation,
    abstract = {{Current source density (CSD) analysis provides an index of the location, direction, and density of transmembrane currents that arise with synchronous activation of neural tissue and that generate an evoked potential profile in the extracellular medium. In neocortex and other laminated structures, a simplified, one-dimensional CSD analysis can be computed by differentiation of voltages sampled at discrete points in a linear array. One-dimensional CSD analysis is a practical and accurate method for defining both regional activity patterns and neural generators of surface-recorded evoked and event-related potentials. In computing the CSD, common practices of differentiating across spatial grids of 200 μm or more and use of spatial smoothing routines help to reduce noise, but severely limit the spatial resolution available to the analysis. High-resolution CSD procedures (i.e., 3 point differentiation using a spatial grid of 100 μm or less) are more suited to identification of processes within individual cortical laminae or sublaminae, but can magnify the contributions of computational artifacts. Despite the inclusion of independent indices of cellular activity (e.g., multiunit activity), both high- and lowresolution analyses may indicate current source and sink configurations for which there is more than one plausible physiological interpretation. In the present study we examined the resolving capacity and pitfalls of common CSD procedures using simulated ensembles of current dipoles. These were positioned and oriented to model the depolarization of lamina 4C stellate cells and thalamocortical afferents in macaque striate cortex. Empirically, the surface N40 appears in association with a CSD configuration which includes current sinks within the thalamorecipient (stellate) subdivisions of lamina 4C and a large current source extending considerably below 4C. Dipole ensemble contributions to the CSD profile were computed and compared to physiological data from this region. Small asymmetries in activation of model stellate laminae were sufficient to produce substantial open field contributions. However, the best fit with empirical CSD profile was found when the simulation included contributions from thalamocortical axons, along with both open and closed field contributions from dual stellate cell sublaminae. High-resolution CSD profiles were shown to be interpretable when computational artifacts characteristic of closed and open fields were identified using a series of differentiation grids.}},

The latencies of the ABR waves are important for clinical and neurophysiological evaluations. Using a biophysical model of transmembrane currents along spiral ganglion cells, we show that in human (i) the non-myelinated somatic regions of type I cells, which innervate inner hair cells, predominantly contribute to peak I, (ii) the supra-strong postsynaptic stimulating current (400 pA) and transmembrane currents of the myelinated peripheral axons of type I cells are an order smaller; such postsynaptic currents correspond to the short latencies of a small recordable ABR peak I', (iii) the ABR signal involvement of the central axon of bipolar type I cells is more effective than their peripheral counterpart as the doubled diameter causes larger transmembrane currents and a larger spike dipole-length, (iv) non-myelinated fibers of type II cells which innervate the outer hair cells generate essentially larger transmembrane currents but their ABR contribution is small because of the small ratio type II/type I cells, low firing rates and a short dipole length of spikes propagating slowly in non-myelinated fibers. Using a finite element model of a simplified head, peaks In and II (where In is the negative peak after peak I) are found to be stationary potentials when volleys of spikes cross the external electrical conductivity barrier at the bone\&dura/CSF and at the CSF/brainstem interface whereas peaks I' and I may be generated by strong local transmembrane currents as postsynaptic events at the distal ending and the soma region of type I cells, respectively.

    abstract = {{The electrochemical processes that underlie neural function manifest themselves in ceaseless spatiotemporal field fluctuations. However, extracellular fields feed back onto the electric potential across the neuronal membrane via ephaptic coupling, independent of synapses. The extent to which such ephaptic coupling alters the functioning of neurons under physiological conditions remains unclear. To address this question, we stimulated and recorded from rat cortical pyramidal neurons in slices with a 12-electrode setup. We found that extracellular fields induced ephaptically mediated changes in the somatic membrane potential that were less than 0.5 mV under subthreshold conditions. Despite their small size, these fields could strongly entrain action potentials, particularly for slow (<8 Hz) fluctuations of the extracellular field. Finally, we simultaneously measured from up to four patched neurons located proximally to each other. Our findings indicate that endogenous brain activity can causally affect neural function through field effects under physiological conditions.}},

The first and second time derivatives of the intracellular action potentials were also recorded. The intracellular action potentials and their first and second time derivatives were almost the same regardless of the place of recording. With the decrease in the axial distance to the end the extracellular action potentials changed gradually in a complicated manner from a shape similar to the second time derivative into a shape similar to the first time derivative.

    abstract = {{The extracellular action potentials (ECAPs) of single active muscle fibres immersed an isotropic volume conductor were investigated. The origination of excitation in the motor end-plate and its reaching the fibre end were taken into consideration. It was explained why at short radial distances the ECAPs over the fibre at points close to the end were similar in shape to the first time derivative and at points close to the motor end-plate-to the first time derivative of the intracellular action potential (ICAP) taken with minus sign. The fibre end changed the ECAP which would be recorded if the fibre was infinite and this change called pure termination potential (PTP) was a biphase positive-negative potential, proportional to the first time derivative of the ICAP at points close to the membrane and over the very end. With increasing the radial and axial distances PTP decreases in amplitude. Taking into account the PTP, the genesis of the terminal positive phase of the ECAPs (Gydikov and Kosarov 1972a, b) can be explained. The onset of the fibre or the motor end-plate also changed the potential which would be recorded if the fibre was infinite. This change was given the term of pure onset potential (POP)-a biphase negative-positive potential, proportional to the first time derivative of the ICAP taken with minus sign at a point close to the membrane and over the motor end-plate. With increasing the radial and the axial distance POP decreased in amplitude.
                            Close to the membrane PTP and POP were commensurable with the potential of an infinite fibre only at points close to the ends or to the motor end-plate. At long radial distances they were commensurable with the potential of an infinite fibre for all axial distances.}},

    abstract = {{
                Using kinetic data from three different K+ currents in acutely isolated neurons, a single electrical compartment representing the soma of a ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) neuron was created. The K+ currents include a fast transient current (IA), a slow-inactivating low-threshold current (ILT), and a noninactivating high-threshold current (IHT). The model also includes a fast-inactivating Na+ current, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), and 1-50 auditory nerve synapses. With this model, the role IA, ILT, and IHT play in shaping the discharge patterns of VCN cells is explored. Simulation results indicate that IHT mainly functions to repolarize the membrane during an action potential, and IA functions to modulate the rate of repetitive firing. ILT is found to be responsible for the phasic discharge pattern observed in Type II cells (bushy cells). However, by adjusting the strength of ILT, both phasic and regular discharge patterns are observed, demonstrating that a critical level of ILT is necessary to produce the Type II response. Simulated Type II cells have a significantly faster membrane time constant in comparison to Type I cells (stellate cells) and are therefore better suited to preserve temporal information in their auditory nerve inputs by acting as precise coincidence detectors and having a short refractory period. Finally, we demonstrate that modulation of Ih, which changes the resting membrane potential, is a more effective means of modulating the activation level of ILT than simply modulating ILT itself. This result may explain why ILT and Ih are often coexpressed throughout the nervous system.

@article{Rathouz1998Characterization,
    abstract = {{Neurons of the nucleus magnocellularis (NM) preserve the timing of auditory signals through the convergence of a variety of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. To understand better how these channels interact, we have characterized the kinetics, voltage sensitivity, and pharmacology of outward currents of NM neurons in brain slices. The reversal potential (E rev) of outward currents varied with potassium concentration as expected for currents carried by potassium. However, E rev was consistently more positive than the Nernst potential for potassium (E K). Deviation of E rev from the calculated E K most likely arose from potassium accumulation in extracellular spaces by potassium conductances active at rest and during depolarizing steps. Three outward potassium currents were studied that varied in voltage and pharmacological sensitivity. A tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive, high-threshold current was activated within 1–5 ms of the onset of depolarization, with a half-maximal activation voltage (V 1/2) of −19 mV. It was blocked partially by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and was the dominant ionic conductance of NM neurons. A dendrotoxin-I (DTX) and 4-AP-sensitive, low-threshold current had a V 1/2 of −58 mV, rapid activation kinetics, and only partial inactivation, with decay time constants between 20 and 100 ms. A rapidly inactivating current was observed that was resistant to TEA and DTX and was blocked by intracellular Cs+. The transient current was inactivated almost completely at the resting potential. The onset of inactivation was fastest at potentials negative to those that caused activation. When intracellular K+ was replaced by Cs+, large inward and outward currents were obtained that corresponded respectively to the above-mentioned DTX- and TEA-sensitive currents. Outward, TEA-sensitive current was carried by Cs+, with a P Cs/P K of ∼0.1. In current-clamped neurons, DTX induced repetitive firing and increased membrane time constant near rest but had little effect on action potential duration. These studies indicate that a low-threshold, DTX-sensitive current plays a key role in making NM neurons highly responsive to the onset and offset of synaptic stimuli.}},

    abstract = {{Neurons initiate spikes in the axon initial segment or at the first node in the axon1, 2, 3, 4. However, it is not yet understood how the site of spike initiation affects neuronal activity and function. In nucleus laminaris of birds, neurons behave as coincidence detectors for sound source localization and encode interaural time differences (ITDs) separately at each characteristic frequency (CF)5, 6, 7. Here we show, in nucleus laminaris of the chick, that the site of spike initiation in the axon is arranged at a distance from the soma, so as to achieve the highest ITD sensitivity at each CF. Na+ channels were not found in the soma of high-CF (2.5–3.3 kHz) and middle-CF (1.0–2.5 kHz) neurons but were clustered within a short segment of the axon separated by 20–50 m from the soma; in low-CF (0.4–1.0 kHz) neurons they were clustered in a longer stretch of the axon closer to the soma. Thus, neurons initiate spikes at a more remote site as the CF of neurons increases. Consequently, the somatic amplitudes of both orthodromic and antidromic spikes were small in high-CF and middle-CF neurons and were large in low-CF neurons. Computer simulation showed that the geometry of the initiation site was optimized to reduce the threshold of spike generation and to increase the ITD sensitivity at each CF. Especially in high-CF neurons, a distant localization of the spike initiation site improved the ITD sensitivity because of electrical isolation of the initiation site from the soma and dendrites, and because of reduction of Na+-channel inactivation by attenuating the temporal summation of synaptic potentials through the low-pass filtering along the axon.}},

    abstract = {{How the axonal distribution of Na+ channels affects the precision of spike timing is not well understood. We addressed this question in auditory relay neurons of the avian nucleus magnocellularis. These neurons encode and convey information about the fine structure of sounds to which they are tuned by generating precisely timed action potentials in response to synaptic inputs. Patterns of synaptic inputs differ as a function of tuning. A small number of large inputs innervate high- and middle-frequency neurons, while a large number of small inputs innervate low-frequency neurons. We found that the distribution and density of Na+ channels in the axon initial segments varied with the synaptic inputs, and were distinct in the low-frequency neurons. Low-frequency neurons had a higher density of Na+ channels within a longer axonal stretch, and showed a larger spike amplitude and whole-cell Na+ current than high/middle-frequency neurons. Computer simulations revealed that for low-frequency neurons, a large number of Na+ channels were crucial for preserving spike timing because it overcame Na+ current inactivation and K+ current activation during compound EPSPs evoked by converging small inputs. In contrast, fewer channels were sufficient to generate a spike with high precision in response to an EPSP induced by a single massive input in the high/middle-frequency neurons. Thus the axonal Na+ channel distribution is effectively coupled with synaptic inputs, allowing these neurons to convey auditory information in the timing of firing.}},

    abstract = {{
                Although extracellular unit recording is typically used for the detection of spike occurrences, it also has the theoretical ability to report about what are typically considered intracellular features of the action potential. We address this theoretical ability by developing a model system that captures features of experimentally recorded simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We use the line source approximation method of Holt and Koch to model the extracellular action potential (EAP) voltage resulting from the spiking activity of individual neurons. We compare the simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo with model predictions for the same cells reconstructed and simulated with compartmental models. The model accurately reproduces both the waveform and the amplitude of the EAPs, although it was difficult to achieve simultaneous good matches on both the intracellular and extracellular waveforms. This suggests that accounting for the EAP waveform provides a considerable constraint on the overall model. The developed model explains how and why the waveform varies with electrode position relative to the recorded cell. Interestingly, each cell's dendritic morphology had very little impact on the EAP waveform. The model also demonstrates that the varied composition of ionic currents in different cells is reflected in the features of the EAP.

    abstract = {{Ephaptic interactions between a neuron and axons or dendrites passing by its cell body can be, in principle, more significant than ephaptic interactions among axons in a fiber tract. Extracellular action potentials outside axons are small in amplitude and spatially spread out, while they are larger in amplitude and much more spatially confined near cell bodies. We estimated the extracellular potentials associated with an action potential in a cortical pyramidal cell using standard one-dimensional cable theory and volume conductor theory. Their spatial and temporal pattern reveal much about the location and timing of currents in the cell, especially in combination with a known morphology, and simple experiments could resolve questions about spike initiation. From the extracellular potential we compute the ephaptically induced polarization in a nearby passive cable. The magnitude of this induced voltage can be several mV, does not spread electrotonically, and depends only weakly on the passive properties of the cable. We discuss their possible functional relevance.}},

                The neurophonic is a sound-evoked, frequency-following potential that can be recorded extracellularly in nucleus laminaris of the barn owl. The origin of the neurophonic, and thus the mechanisms that give rise to its exceptional temporal precision, has not yet been identified. Putative generators of the neurophonic are the activity of afferent axons, synaptic activation of laminaris neurons, or action potentials in laminaris neurons. To identify the generators, we analyzed the neurophonic in the high-frequency (>2.5 kHz) region of nucleus laminaris in response to monaural pure-tone stimulation. The amplitude of the neurophonic is typically in the millivolt range. The signal-to-noise ratio reaches values beyond 30 dB. To assess which generators could give rise to these large, synchronous extracellular potentials, we developed a computational model. Spike trains were produced by an inhomogeneous Poisson process and convolved with a spike waveform. The model explained the dependence of the simulated neurophonic on parameters such as the mean rate, the vector strength of phase locking, the number of statistically independent sources, and why the signal-to-noise ratio is independent of the spike waveform and subsequent filtering of the signal. We found that several hundred sources are needed to reach the observed signal-to-noise ratio. The summed coherent signal from the densely packed afferent axons and activation of their synapses on laminaris neurons are alone sufficient to explain the measured properties of the neurophonic.
